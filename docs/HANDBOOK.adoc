XL is an extensible programming language, designed to accomodate a
variety of programming needs with ease.

Being _extensible_ means that the language is designed to make it very
easy for programmers to adapt the language to suit their needs, for
example by adding new programming constructs. In XL, extending the
language is a routine operation, much like adding a function or
creating a class in more traditional programming languages.
This extensibility is demonstrated by the fact that operations that
are built-in in other programming languages, such as integer
arithmetic, basic types or loops, are part of the
link:#standard-library[((standard library))] in XL.

As a consequence of this extensibility, XL is intended to be suitable
for programming tasks ranging from the simplest to the most complex,
from documents and application scripting, as illustrated by
https://tao3d.sf.net[Tao3D], to compilers, as illustrated by the XL2
link:{xl}xl2/native[self-compiling compiler] to distributed
programming, as illustrated by https://github.com/c3d/elfe[ELFE].

WARNING: XL is a work in progress. Even if there are some bits and
pieces that happen to already work, and even if there were fully
functioning releases like the XL version used in https://tao3d.sf.net[Tao3D]
in the past, XL is being totally reworked, and the compiler in this
repository is presently not suitable for any serious
programming. Examples given below may sometimes simply not work. Take
it as a painful reminder that the work is far from finished, and, who
knows, as an idea for a contribution. See link:#history-of-xl[HISTORY]
for how we came to the present mess. The link:{xl}README.md[README]
gives a quick overview of the language.

== Introduction to XL

Extensible? What does that mean for a programming language? For XL, it
really means three things:

[arabic]
. XL has a method to extend the language(((extensible,language))) with any
  kind of feature, not just functions or data types, but also
  ((programming construct))s, ((optimization))s, ((domain-specific
  notation))s, and more. Actually, all this is done with a
  link:#one-operator-to-rule-them-all[single operator], `is`, called
  the _((definition operator))_.

. As a validation of the concept, most features that are ((built-in)) in
  other ((programming language))s, like the `while` ((loop)), or ((integer
  arithmetic)), are _constructed_ in XL. Specifically, they are provided by
  the link:#the-standard-library[((standard library))], using techniques that
  any programmer can use in their program. This, obviously, means that
  programmers can add their own loops, or their own machine-level data
  types, and even extend existing ones.

. XL provides link:#efficient-translation[complete control] over the
  ((program translation)) process. This means that libraries(((library)))
  exist or can be written to make XL at least as good as C for
  low-level ((bit-twiddling)), at least as good as {cpp} for ((generic
  algorithms)), at least as good as Ada for ((tasking)), at least as
  good as Fortran for ((numerical algorithms)), at least as good as
  Java for ((distributed programming)), and so on.

This may all seem too good to be true. This document explains how the
magic happens. But first of all, one thing that really matters: XL is
supposed to be _simple_. Let’s start with a few well-known examples to
prove this.

=== Two basic examples

It is practically compulsory to begin the presentation of any
programming language with a
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program["Hello
World"] example, immediately followed by a a
recursive definition of the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial[factorial function]. Let’s
follow this long honored tradition.

==== Hello World

In XL, a program that prints `((Hello World))` on the terminal ((console))
output will look like this:

[source]
----
use XL.CONSOLE.TEXT_IO
print "Hello World"
----

The first line _imports_(((import))) the `XL.CONSOLE.TEXT_IO`
link:#modules[((module))].  The program can then use the `print`
function from that module to write the text on the ((terminal
console)).

Why do we need the `use` ((statement))? There is a general rule in XL
that you only pay for things that you use. Not all programs will use a
terminal console, so the corresponding functions must be explicitly
imported into a program. It is possible that some systems, like
embedded systems, don’t even have a terminal console. On such a
system, the corresponding module would not be available, and the
program would properly fail to compile.

What is more interesting, though, is the definition of `print`. That
definition is link:#the-case-of-text-input-output-operations[discussed
below], and you will see that it is quite simple, in particular when
compared with similar input/output operations in languages such
as {cpp}.

Another interesting, if slightly more complicated version of "Hello
World" is one written in the link:https://tao3d.sf.net[Tao3D] dialect
of XL that produces this result:

video::6WIMWlUZJvs[youtube,title=Helo World in Tao3D,width=800,height=600]

.Source code for the Tao3D "Hello World"

=====

The source code for this example can be found below. The Tao3D dialect
of XL still uses `+->+` instead of `is` as the definition
operator. Apart from that change, the following code is valid XL for
the language described in this document.

        color 100% , 90% , 20% , 90%
        sphere 0, 0, 0, R

==== Factorial

A program computing the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial[((factorial))]
of numbers between 1 and 5, and then showing them on the console, can
be written as follows:

[source]
----
use IO = XL.CONSOLE.TEXT_IO

0! is 1
N! is N * (N-1)!

for I in 1..5 loop
    IO.print "The factorial of ", I, " is ", I!
----

We have used an alternative form of the `use` statement, where the
imported module is given a local nick-name, `IO`. This form is useful
when it’s important to avoid the risk of ((name collisions)) between
modules. In that case, the programmer need to refer to the `print`
function of the module as `IO.print`.

The ((definition)) of the factorial function shows how expressive XL is,
making it possible to use the well-known ((notation)) for the factorial
function. The definition consists in two parts:

* the ((special case)) of the factorial of `0` is defined as follows:
+
[source]
----
0! is 1
----
* the general case is defined as follows, and involves a ((recursion)) in
the form of the `(N-1)!` expression:
+
[source]
----
N! is N * (N-1)!
----

That definition would not detect a problem with something like `-3!`. The
second form would match, and presumably enter an ((infinite recursion)) that would
exhaust available ((stack space)). It is possible to fix that problem by
indicating that the definition only works for positive numbers:

[source]
----
0!              is 1
N!  when N > 0  is N * (N-1)!
----

Writing the code that way will ensure that there is a ((compile-time error))
for code like `-3!`, because there is no definition that matches.

=== One operator to rule them all

[[definition]]
XL has a single fundamental operator, `is`, called the _((definition
operator))_. It is an link:#infix[infix operator] with a
link:#pattern[((pattern))] on the left and an
link:#implementation[((implementation))] on the right. In other words,
the pattern for the infix `is` is `Pattern is Implementation`, where
`Pattern` is a program pattern, like `X+Y`, and `Implementation` is an
implementation for that pattern, for example `Add X, Y`. This ((operator))
can also be read as _transforms into_, i.e. it transforms the code
that is on the left into the code that is on the right.

This single ((operator)) can be used to define all kinds of entities.

NOTE: link:#types[((type))s] in XL indicate the shape of ((parse tree))s. In
other words, the `cartesian` type above will match any parse tree that
takes the shape of the word `cartesian` followed by two numbers, like
for example `cartesian(1,5)`.

add3            is      ( adder 3 )

 // This will compute 8
 add3 5
----

The notation `lambda X`, which can also be written `\X`, is inspired by
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus[lambda calculus]. It makes
it possible to create link:#pattern[patterns] that match entire
expressions. In other words, `X is 0` defines a name, and only the
expression `X` matches that definition, whereas `\X is 0` defines a
"catch-all" pattern that will match `35` or `"ABC"`. This _((lambda))
notation_ can be used to build something that behaves almost exactly
like an _((anonymous function))_ in functional languages, although the way
it actually works internally is link:#scoping[still based on pattern
matching].

[NOTE]
=====
The current implementations of XL special-case single-defintion
contexts, and `lambda` can be omitted in that case. In a normal context,
`X is Y` defines a name `X`, but it did not seem very useful to have
single-definition contexts defining only a name. The above example could
have been written as:

[source]
----
adder N is (X is N + X)
----

However, this is not consistent with the rest of the language, and
`lambda` will be required in future implementations.

// The following is "World"
my_map 8

// The following is 32
my_map[27]

// The following is 45
my_map (44)
----

This provides a functionality roughly equivalent to `std::map` in C++.
However, it’s really nothing more than a regular function with a number
of special cases. The compiler can optimize special kinds of mapping to
provide an efficient implementation, for example if all the indexes are
contiguous integers.

----
====

In short, the single `is` operator covers all the kinds of declarations
that are found in other languages, using a single, easy to read syntax.

=== The standard library

Each ((programming language)) offers a specific set of features, which
are characteristic of that language. Most languages offer integer
arithmetic, floating-point arithmetic, comparisons, boolean logic,
text manipulation (often called "_((string))s_"), but also programming
constructs such as loops, tests, and so on.

XL provides most features programmers are used to, but they are
defined in the XL _((standard library))_, not by the compiler. The
standard library is guaranteed to be present in all implementations
and behave identically. However, it is written using only tools that
are available to a regular developer, not just to compiler writers.

==== Usual programming features

Definitions in the standard library include common fixtures of
programming that are built-in in other languages, in particular
well-known ((programming construct))s such as ((loop))s, ((test))s,
and so on.

For example, the _((if statement))_ in XL is defined in the standard
library as follows:

[source]
----
if [[true]]  then TrueClause else FalseClause   is TrueClause   // <1>
if [[false]] then TrueClause else FalseClause   is FalseClause
if [[true]]  then TrueClause                    is TrueClause
if [[false]] then TrueClause                    is false
----

<1> A value between two square brackets, as in `+[[true]]+` and
`+[[false]]+`, is called a link:#metabox[((metabox))].
It indicates that the pattern must match the actual values in the
metabox. In other words, `+foo true is ...+` defines a pattern with a
formal parameter named `true`, whereas `+foo [[true]] is ...+` defines a
pattern which only matches when the argument is equal to constant
`true`.

Similarly, the `while` loop is defined as follows:

[source]
----
while Condition loop Body is
    if Condition then
        Body
        while Condition loop Body
----

With the definitions above, programmers can then use `if` and `while`
in their programs much like they would in any other programming
language, as in the following code that verifies the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture[((Syracuse conjecture))]:

[source]
----
while N <> 1 loop
    if N mod 2 = 0 then
        N /= 2
    else
        N := N * 3 + 1
    print N
----


==== The next natural evolutionary step

Moving ((features)) to a ((library)) is a natural evolution for
programming languages. Consider for example the case of ((text I/O))
operations. They used to be ((built-in)) for ((early languages)) such
as BASIC’s `((PRINT))` or Pascal’s `((WriteLn))`, but they moved to the
library in later languages such as C with `((printf))`. As a result, C has
a much wider variety of I/O functions. The same observation can be
made on text manipulation and math functions, which were all built-in
in BASIC, but all implemented as library functions in C. For ((tasking)),
Ada has built-in construct, C has the `pthread` library. And so on.

Yet, while C moved a very large number of things to libraries, it still
did not go all the way. The meaning of `x+1` in C is defined strictly by
the compiler. So is the meaning of `x/3`, even if some implementations
that lack a hardware implementation of division have to make a call to
a library function to actually implement that code.

{cpp} went one step further than C, allowing programmers to
_((overload))_ operators, i.e. redefine the meaning of an operation
like `X+1`, but only for ((custom data types)), and only for already
existing operators. In {cpp}, a programmer cannot _create_ the
_((spaceship operator))_ `+<=>+` using the standard language mechanisms.
It has to be implemented in the compiler. The spaceship operator has to be
http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2017/p0515r0.pdf[added
to the language by compiler writers], and it takes a 35-pages article
to discuss the implications. This takes time and a large effort, since
all compiler writers must implement the same thing.

By contrast, all it takes in XL to implement `+<=>+` in a variant that
always returns `-1`, `0` or `1` is the following:

[source]
----
syntax { INFIX 290 <=> }
X <=> Y     when X < Y  is -1
X <=> Y     when X = Y  is  0
X <=> Y     when X > Y  is  1
----

Similarly, C++ makes it extremely difficult to optimize(((optimization)))
away an expression like `X*0`, `X*1` or `X+0` using only standard
programming techniques, whereas XL makes it extremely easy:

[source]
----
X*0     is 0
X*1     is X
X+0     is X
----

Finally, {cpp} also makes it very difficult to deal with expressions
containing multiple operators. For example, many modern CPUs feature a
form of
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply–accumulate_operation#Fused_multiply–add[fused multiply-add], which has benefits that include performance and
precision. Yet {cpp} will not allow you to overload `X*Y+Z` to
use this kind of operations. In XL, this is not a problem at all:

[source]
----
X*Y+Z   is FusedMultiplyAdd(X,Y,Z)
----

In other words, the XL approach represents the next logical
((evolutionary step)) for ((programming language))s along a line
already followed by highly-successful ancestors.

==== Benefits of moving features to a library

Putting basic features in the ((standard library)), as opposed to keeping
them in the compiler, has several benefits:

[arabic]
. Flexibility(((flexible,library))): It is much easier to offer a
  large number of behaviors and to address ((special case))s.
. Clarity(((clarity,library))): The definition given in the library gives a very clear and
  machine-verifiable description of the operation.
. Extensibility(((extensible,library))): If the library definition is
  not sufficient, it is possible to add what you need. It will behave
  exactly as what is in the library. If it proves useful enough, it
  may even make it to the standard library in a later iteration of the
  language.
. Fixability(((fixable,library))): Built-in mechanisms, such as
  library versioning(((version,library))), make it possible to
  address ((bug))s without breaking existing code, which can still use
  an earlier version of the library.

The XL standard library consists of a link:{xl}native/lib[wide variety of
modules]. The top-level ((module)) is called `XL`, and sub-modules are
categorized in a hierarchy(((hierarchy,modules))). For example, if you
need to perform computations on ((complex number))s, you would `use
XL.MATH.COMPLEX` to load the
link:{xl}native/lib/xl/math/complex.xs[complex numbers module]

The link:{xl}src/builtins.xl[library builtins] is a list of definitions
that are accessible to any XL program without any explicit `use`
statement. This includes most features that you find in languages such
as C, for example integer arithmetic or loops. Compiler options make it
possible to load another file instead, or even to load no file at all,
in which case you need to build everything from scratch.

==== The case of text input / output operations

Input/output(((input/output))) operations (often abbreviated as ((I/O))) are a fundamental
brick in most programming languages. In general, ((I/O operations)) are
somewhat complex. If you are curious, the source code for the venerable
`printf` function in C is
https://github.com/lattera/glibc/blob/master/stdio-common/vfprintf.c[available
online].

[[print]]
The implementation of text I/O in XL is comparatively very simple. The
definition of `print` looks something like, where irrelevant
implementation details were elided as `...`:

[source]
----
write X:text            as mayfail      is ... // <1>
write X:integer         as mayfail      is ...
write X:real            as mayfail      is ...
write X:character       as mayfail      is ...
write [[true]]          as mayfail      is { write "true"  } // <2>
write [[false]]         as mayfail      is { write "false" }
write Head, Rest        as mayfail      is { write Head; write Rest }

print                   as mayfail      is { write SOME_NEWLINE_CHARACTER }
print Items             as mayfail      is { write Items; print }
----

<1> The link:#fallible-types[mayfail] type is used to represent
    the `nil or error` type, in other words it indicates that the
    function either returns nothing, or returns an error.

<2> The `+[[true]]+` notation is called a link:#metabox[metabox],
    and indicates that we must match the value of the expression
    in the metabox, in that case, `true`.

This is an example of _((variadic function)) definition_ in XL. In
other words, `print` can take a ((variable number of arguments)), much
like `printf` in C. You can write multiple comma-separated items in a
`print`. For example, consider the following code:

[source]
----
print "The value of X is ", X, " and the value of Y is ", Y
----

That would first call the last definition of `print` with the following
link:#binding[((binding))] for the variable `Items`:

[source]
----
Items   is "The value of X is ", X, " and the value of Y is ", Y
----

This in turn is passed to `write`, and the definition that matches is
`write Head, Rest` with the following bindings:

[source]
----
Head    is "The value of X is "
Rest    is X, " and the value of Y is ", Y
----

In that case, `write Head` will directly match `write X:text` and write
some text on the console. On the other hand, `write Rest` will need to
iterate once more through the `write Head, Rest` definition, this time
with the following bindings:

[source]
----
Head    is X
Rest    is " and the value of Y is ", Y
----

The call to `write Head` will then match one of the implementations of
`write`, depending on the actual type of `X`. For example, if `X` is an
integer, then it will match with `write X:integer`. Then the last ((split))
occurs for `write Rest` with the following bindings:

[source]
----
Head    is " and the value of Y is "
Rest    is Y
----

For that last iteration, `write Head` will use the `write X:text`
definition, and `write Rest` will use whatever definition of `write`
matches the type of `Y`.

All this can be done at compile-time. The generated code can then be
reused whenever the combination of argument types is the same. For
example, if `X` and `Y` are `integer` values, the generated code could
be used for the following code:

[source]
----
print "The sum is ", X+Y, " and the difference is ", X-Y
----

[[print_instances]]
This is because the sequence of types is the same. Everything happens as
if the above mechanism had created a series of additional definition
that looks like:

[source]
----
print A:text, B:integer, C:text, D:integer is
    write A, B, C, D
    print

write A:text, B:integer, C:text, D:integer is
    write A
    write B, C, D

write B:integer, C:text, D:integer is
    write B
    write C, D

write C:text, D:integer is
    write C
    write D
----

All these definitions are then available as shortcuts whenever the
compiler evaluates future function calls.

The `print` function as defined above is both type-safe(((type
safety))) and extensible(((extensible,function))),
unlike similar facilities found for example in the C programming
language.

It is type-safe because the compiler knows the type of each argument at
every step, and can check that there is a matching `write` function.

It is extensible, because additional definitions of `write` will be
considered when evaluating `write Items`. For example, if you add a
`complex` type similar to the one defined by the ((standard library)), all
you need for that type to become "writable" is to add a definition of
`write` that looks like:

[source]
----
write Z:complex     is write "(", Z.Re, ";", Z.Im, ")"
----

Unlike the {cpp} `iostream` facility, the XL compiler will naturally emit
less code. In particular, it will need only one function call for every
call to `print`, calling the generated function for the given
combination of arguments. That function will in turn call other
generated functions, but the code sequence corresponding to a
particular sequence of arguments will be factored out between all the
call sites, minimizing ((code bloat)).

Additionally, the approach used in XL makes it possible to offer
specific features for output lines, for example to ensure that a
single line is always printed contiguously even in a multi-threaded
scenario(((thread safety))).  Assuming a `single_thread` facility
ensuring that the code is executed by at most one thread, creating a
locked `print` is nothing more than:

[source]
----
locked_print Items is
    single_thread
         print Items
----

It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to achieve a similar
effect with {cpp} `iostream` or, more generally, with I/O facilities that
perform one call per I/O item. That’s because there is no way for the
compiler to identify where the "line breaks" are in your code.

=== Efficient translation

Despite being very high-level, XL was designed so that ((efficient
translation)) to machine code was possible, if sometimes
challenging. In other words, XL is designed to be able to work as a
_((system language))_, in the same vein as C, Ada or Rust, i.e. a
language that can be used to program ((operating system))s, system
libraries(((library,system))), ((compiler))s or other low-level
applications.

For that reason, nothing in the semantics of XL mandates complex
behind-the-scene activites, like ((garbage collection)), ((thread
safety)), or even ((memory management)). As for other aspects of the
language, any such activity has to be provided by the library. You
only pay for it if you actually use it. In other words, the only
reason you’d ever get garbage collection in an XL program is if you
explicitly need it for your own application.

This philosophy sometimes requires the XL compiler to work extra hard
in order to be more than minimally efficient. Consider for example the
definition of the `while` loop(((loop,optimization)))(((optimization,loop)))
given above:

[source]
----
while Condition loop Body is
    if Condition then
        Body
        while Condition loop Body
----

That definition can be used in your own code as follows:

[source]
----
while N <> 1 loop
    if N mod 2 = 0 then N /= 2 else N := N * 3 + 1
----

What happens is that the compiler looks at the code, and matches against
the definitions at its disposal. The `while` loop in the code matches
the form `while Condition loop Body`, provided you do the following
link:#binding[((binding))s]:

[source]
----
Conditions is N <> 1
Body is
   if N mod 2 = 0 then N /= 2 else N := N * 3 + 1
----

The definition for the `while Condition loop Body` form is then
evaluated with the above bindings, in other words, the code below then
needs to be evaluated:

[source]
----
    if Condition then
        Body
        while Condition loop Body
----

Conceptually, that is extremely simple. Getting this to work well is
of course a little bit complicated. In particular, the definition ends
with another reference to `while`. If the compiler naively generates a
_function call_ to implement a form like that, executing that code
would likely run out of ((stack space)) for loops with a large number
of iterations. A special optimization(((loop,optimization)))(((optimization,loop)))
called _((tail call elimination))_ is required to ensure the expected
behavior, namely the generation of a machine branch instruction
instead of a machine call instruction.

Furthermore, the ((reference implementation)) is just that, a
reference. The compiler is perfectly allowed, even encouraged, to
"cheat", i.e. to recognize common idioms, and efficiently translate
them. One name, `builtin`, is reserved for that purpose. For example,
the definition of integer addition may look like this:

[source]
----
X:integer + Y:integer as integer    is builtin Add
----

The left part of `is` here is perfectly standard XL. It tells the
compiler that an expression like `X+Y` where both `X` and `Y` have the
`integer` type will result in an `integer` value (that is the meaning of
`as integer`). The implementation, however, is not given. Instead, the
`builtin Add` tells the compiler that it has a cheat sheet for that
operations, called `Add`. How this cheat sheet is actually implemented
is not specified, and depends on the compiler.

=== Adding complex features

Features can be added to the language that go beyond a simple notation.
This can also be done in XL, although this may require a little bit of
additional work. This topic cannot be covered extensively here. Instead,
examples from existing implementations will provide hints of how this
can happen(((extensible,language))).

==== Reactive programming in Tao3D

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming[Reactive programming]
is a form of programming designed to facilitate the propagation of
changes in a program. It is particularly useful to react to changes in a
((user interface)).

https://tao3d.sf.net[((Tao3D))] added ((reactive programming)) to XL to deal
with user-interface events, like ((mouse)) movements or ((keyboard)) input.
This is achieved in Tao3D using a combination of _((partial re-evaluation))_
of programs in response to _((event))s_ sent by functions that depend
on user-interface state.

For example, consider the following Tao3D program to draw the hands of a
clock (see complete https://youtu.be/apy5csu0DkE[YouTube tutorial] for
more details):

[source]
----
locally
    rotate_z -6 * minutes
    rectangle 0, 100, 15, 250

locally
    rotate_z -30 * hours
    rectangle 0, 50, 15, 150

locally
    color "red"
    rotate_z -6 * seconds
    rectangle 0, 80, 10, 200
----

The `locally` function controls the ((scope)) of partial
re-evaluation.  Time-based functions(((time))) like `minutes`, `hours`
or `seconds` return the minutes, hours and seconds of the current
time, respectively, but also trigger a time event each time they
change. For example, the `hours` function will trigger a time event
every hour.

The `locally` function controls partial re-evaluation of the code within
it, and caches all drawing-related information within it in a structure
called a _layout_. There is also a top-level layout for anything created
outside of a `locally`.

The first time the program is evaluated, three layouts are created by
the three `locally` calls, and populated with three rectangles (one of
them colored in red), which were rotated along the Z axis (perpendicular
to the screen) by an amount depending on time. When, say, the `seconds`
value changes, a time event is sent by `seconds`, which is intercepted
by the enclosing `locally`, which then re-evaluated its contents, and
then sends a redraw event to the enclosing layout. The two other layouts
will use the cached graphics, without re-evaluating the code under
`locally`.

All this can be implemented entirely within the constraints of the
normal XL ((evaluation)) rules. In other words, the language did not have to
be changed in order to implement Tao3D.

==== Declarative programming in Tao3D

Tao3D also demonstrates how a single language can be used to define
documents in a way that feels declarative like a ((declarative language)),
i.e. similar to HTML, but still offers the power of ((imperative programming))
like JavaScript, as well as style sheets reminiscent of CSS. In other
words, Tao3D does with a single language, XL, what HTML5 does with
three.

For example, an ((interactive)) ((slide)) in Tao3D would be written
using code like this (note that Tao3D uses `import` instead of `use`):

[source]
----
import Slides

slide "The XL programming language",
    * "Extensible"
    * "Powerful"
    * "Simple"
----

This can easily be mis-interpreted as being a mere ((markup language)),
something similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown[markdown],
which is one reason why I sometimes refer to XL as an _XML without the
M_.

However, the true power of XL can more easily be shown by adding the
clock defined previously, naming it `clock`, and then using it in the
slide. This introduces the dynamic aspect that Javascript brings to
HTML5.

[source]
----
import Slides

clock is
    locally
        line_color "blue"
        color "lightgray"
        circle 0, 0, 300

    locally
        rotate_z -6 * minutes
        rectangle 0, 100, 15, 250

    locally
        rotate_z -30 * hours
        rectangle 0, 50, 15, 150

    locally
        color "red"
        rotate_z -6 * seconds
        rectangle 0, 80, 10, 200

slide "The XL programming language",
    * "Extensible"
    * "Powerful"
    * "Simple"
    anchor
        translate_x 600
        clock
----

In order to illustrate how link:#pattern-matching[((pattern matching))]
provides a powerful method to define styles, one can add the following
definition to the program in order to change the font for the titles
(more specifically, to change the ((font)) for the "title" layouts of all
themes and all slide masters):

[source]
----
theme_font Theme, Master, "title" is font "Palatino", 80, italic
----

The result of this program is an animated slide that looks like the
following:

image:images/Tao3D-clock.png[Animated clock]

==== Distributed programming with ELFE

https://github.com/c3d/elfe[ELFE] is another XL-based experiment
targeting ((distributed programming)), notably for the ((Internet of things)).
The idea was to use the link:#homoiconic[((homoiconic))] aspect of XL
to evaluate parts of the program on different machines, by sending the
relevant program fragments and the associated data over the wire for
((remote evaluation)).

NOTE: ELFE is now integrated as part of XL, and the ELFE demos are
stored in the link:{xl}demo[demo] directory of XL.

This was achieved by adding only four relatively simple XL functions:

* `tell` sends a program to another node in a "fire and forget" way,
  not expecting any response.
* `ask` evaluates a remote program that returns a value, and returns
  that value to the calling program.
* `invoke` evaluates a remote program, establishing a two-way
  communication with the remote that the remote can use with `reply`
* `reply` allows remote code within an `invoke` to evaluate code in its
  original caller’s context, but with access to all the local variables
  declared by the remote.

Consider the link:{xl}demo/7-two-hops.xl[following program]:

[source]
----
WORKER_1 is "pi2.local"
WORKER_2 is "pi.local"

invoke WORKER_1,
   every 1.1s,
        rasp1_temp is
            ask WORKER_2,
                temperature
        send_temps rasp1_temp, temperature

   send_temps T1:real, T2:real is
       if abs(T1-T2) > 2.0 then
           reply
               show_temps T1, T2

show_temps T1:real, T2:real is
    print "Temperature on pi is ", T1, " and on pi2 ", T2, ". "
    if T1>T2 then
        print "Pi is hotter by ", T1-T2, " degrees"
    else
        print "Pi2 is hotter by ", T2-T1, " degrees"
----

This small program looks like a relatively simple control script.
However, the way it runs is extremely interesting.

[arabic]
. This single program actually runs on three different machines, the
  original controller, as well as two machines called `WORKER_1` and
  `WORKER_2`.
. It still looks and feels like a single program. In particular,
  variables, values and function calls are passed around machines almost
  transparently. For example
  * the computation `T1-T2` in `send_temps` is performed on `WORKER_1`…
  * … using a value of `T1` that actually came from `WORKER_2` through the
    `ask` statement in `rasp1_temp`.
  * Whenever the `reply` code is executed, variable `T1` and `T2` live on
    `WORKER_1`…
  * … but within the `reply`, they are passed transparently as arguments
    in order to call `show_temps` on the controller.
. Communication occurs primarily between `WORKER_1` and `WORKER_2`,
  which exchange a message every 1.1s. Communication with the controller
  only occurs if and when necessary. If the controller resides in Canada
  and the workers in Australia, this can save substantial networking
  costs.
. A single `temperature` function, with an extremely simple
  implementation, provides an remarkably rich set of remotely-accessible
  features that might require a very complex API in other languages.

This last point is worth insisting on. The following program uses the
same function to compute the minimum, maximum and average ((temperature)) on
the remote node. Nothing was changed to the temperature ((API)). The
computations are performed efficiently by the remote node.

[source]
----
invoke "pi.local",
    min   is 100.0
    max   is 0.0
    sum   is 0.0
    count is 0

    compute_stats T:real is
        min   := min(T, min)
        max   := max(T, max)
        sum   := sum + T
        count := count + 1
        reply
            report_stats count, T, min, max, sum/count

    every 2.5s,
        compute_stats temperature

report_stats Count, T, Min, Max, Avg is
    print "Sample ", Count, " T=", T, " ",
          "Min=", Min, " Max=", Max, " Avg=", Avg
----

NOTE: The definitions of `min`, `max`, `sum` and `count` would not be
acceptable in the version of XL described in this document. You would
need to write for example `min : real := 100` instead of `min is 100.0`,
since `min is 100.0` would declare a constant.

To run the ELFE demos, you need to start an XL server on the machines
called `pi.local` and `pi2.local`, using the `-remote` command-line
option of XL:

[source]
----
% xl -remote
----

You can then run the program on a third machine with:

[source]
----
% xl 7-two-hops.xl
----

Like for Tao3D, the implementation of these functions is not very
complicated, and more importantly, it did not require any kind of change
to the basic XL ((evaluation)) rules. In other words, adding something as
sophisticated as transparently distributed progrmming to XL can be done
by practically any programmer, without changing the compiler.


== [[syntax]]XL syntax

For programmers familiar with other ((programming language))s, the
((syntax)) of XL may not seem very innovative at first, and that is
intentional. Most programmers should be able to read and write correct
XL code in a matter of minutes.

The first noticable thing is a disturbing lack of all these nice
semi-random ((punctuation)) characters that have decorated programs since
the dawn of computing and make most source code look like an ornate form
of ((line noise)) to the uninitiated. Where are all the ((parenthese))s gone?
Why this horrible lack of ((curly brace))s? How can you make sense of a
program without a ((semi-colon)) to
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages_(syntax)#Statements[terminate
or separate] ((statement))s?

In reality, the difference between XL syntax and earlier programming
languages is much more than skin deep. The syntax of XL is actually one
of its most unique characteristics. The design of the XL syntax is
essential to understand both the philosophy and implementation of the
whole language.

=== [[homoiconic]]Homoiconic representation of programs

XL is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity[homoiconic
language](((homoiconic))), meaning that all XL programs are data and
conversely. This makes it particularly easy for programs to manipulate
programs, an approach sometimes referred to as
_((metaprogramming))_. Metaprogramming is the foundation upon which the
touted extensibility of XL is built.

==== Why Lisp remains so strong to this day

In that respect, XL is very much inspired by one of the earliest and
most enduring high-level programming languages,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)[((Lisp))]. The
earliest implementations of Lisp date back to 1958, yet that language
remains surprisingly modern and flourishing today, unlike languages of
that same era like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL[((Cobol))] or
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran[((Fortran))].

One reason for Lisp’s endurance is the metaprogramming capabilities
deriving from homoiconicity. If you want to add a feature to Lisp, all
you need is to write a program that translates Lisp programs with the
new feature into previous-generation Lisp programs. This kind of
capability made it much easier to add
((object-oriented programming))
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Object_System[to Lisp] than
to languages like C: neither link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B[C++]
nor https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C[Objective C] were
implemented as just another C library, and there was a reason for
that. Unlike Lisp, C is not extensible(((extensible,language))).

Despite its strengths, Lisp remains confined to specific markets, in
large part because to most programmers, the language remains
surprisingly alien to this day, even garnering such infamous nicknames
as "__Lots of Insipid and Stupid Parentheses__". As seen from a
link:#concept-programming[((concept programming))] point of view, the
underlying problem is that the Lisp syntax departs from the usual
((notation))s as used by human beings. For example, adding 1 and 2 is
written `1+2` in XL, like in most programming languages, but `(+ 1 2)`
in Lisp. In concept programming, this notational problem is called
_((syntactic noise))_.

XL addresses this problem by putting human usability first. In that
sense, it can be seen as an effort to make the power of Lisp more
((accessible)). That being said, XL is quite a bit more than just Lisp
with a new fancy and ((programmer-friendly)) syntax.

==== [[parse-tree]]The XL parse tree

The XL ((syntax)) is much _simpler_ than that of languages such as C, and
arguably not really more complicated than the syntax of Lisp. The
link:{xl}src/parser.cpp[((parser))] for XL is less than 800 lines of
straightforward {cpp} code, and the link:{xl}src/scanner.cpp[((scanner))]
barely adds another 900 lines. By contrast, the
https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/gcc/c/c-parser.c[C parser]
in GCC needs more than 20000 lines of code, which is about the size of a
complete XL interpreter, and the
https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/gcc/cp/parser.c[C++ parser]
is over twice as much!

A key to keeping things really simple is that the XL syntax is
_dynamic_. Available operators and their precedence are _configured_
primarily through a link:{xl}src/xl.syntax[syntax file]. As a result,
there are no hard-coded keywords or special operators in the XL
compiler.

All XL programs can be represented with a very simple tree structure,
called a _((parse tree))_. The XL parse tree contains _((leaf node))s_
that don't have any children, such as ((integer)), ((real)), ((text))
or ((symbol)) nodes, and _((inner node))s_ that have at least
one child node, such as ((infix)), ((prefix)), ((postfix)) and
((block)) nodes. In general, when a node can have children, these
children can be of any kind.

Leaf nodes contain values that are ((atomic)) as far as XL is concerned:

[arabic]
. [[integer]]`integer` nodes represent non-negative whole numbers
  like `1234`, `2#1001` or `16#FFFE_FFFF`.
. [[real]]`real` nodes represent a floating-point approximation of
  real numbers like `1.234`, `1.5e-10` or `2#1.0001_0001#e24`.
. [[character]]`character` nodes represent individual characters, like `'A'`.
. [[text]]`text` nodes represent text values like `"Hello world"`
. [[name]]`name` nodes represent names like `JOHN_DOE`
. [[operator]]`operator` nodes represent non-alphabetical operators
  like `+<=>+`.
. [[symbols]]`symbols` nodes regroup names, symbols and a special empty
  symbol used in the representation of empty blocks like `()`.
. [[data]]`data` nodes hold an arbitrary amount of binary data.

Inner nodes contains combinations of other XL nodes:

[arabic]
. [[infix]]`infix` nodes represent two operands separated by a name or operator,
  like `A+B` or `X and Y`. Infix nodes with a "new line" name are used
  for separate program lines.
. [[prefix]]`prefix` nodes represent two nodes where the operand follows the
  operator, like `+A` or `sin X`.
. [[postfix]]`postfix` nodes represent two nodes where the operator follows the
  operand, like `3%` or `45km`.
. [[block]]`block` nodes represent a node surrounded by two delimiters, like
  `[a]`, `(a)`, `{a}`. Blocks are also used to represent indentation.
. [[parenthese_block]]`parenthese_block` nodes are delimited with `(` and `)`.
. [[square_block]]`square_block` nodes are delimited with `[` and `]`.
. [[curly_block]]`curly_block` nodes are delimited with `{` and `}`.
. [[indent]]`indent_block` nodes are delimited by
  link:#indentation[code indentation].

For example, let’s consider the following code:

[source]
----
if X < 0 then
   print "The value of ", X, " is negative"
   X := -X
----

Assuming that this program is stored in a file called `program.xl`, the
XL parse tree for this program can be obtained by using the following
command:

[source,shell]
----
% xl -parse program.xl -style debug -show
(infixthen
 (prefix
  if
  (infix<
   X
   0))
 (block indent
  (infix CR
   (prefix
    print
    (infix,
     "The value of "
     (infix,
      X
      " is negative"
     )))
   (infix:=
    X
    (prefix
     -
     X
    )))))
----

All of XL is built on this very simple link:#parse-tree-types[data structure].
Some choices, like having distinct `integer` and `real` node, were
guided primarily by considerations beyond syntax, for example the need
to be able to precisely define link:#evaluation[program evaluation] or
to represent distinct machine types.

[NOTE]
====
The list of node types given above is what the current implementations
of XL offer. Some changes may happen in the future, notably:

[[bits]]
* Adding a "((binary object))" node type, which could be used to store
  binary data in the program. A possible syntax would be to prefix
  `bits` before a large integer value or file name:
[source]
----
bits 16#FF_00_FF_00_FF_FF_00_FF_00
bits "image.png"
----
* Finding a better representation for empty blocks such as `+()+`.
  In the current implementation, they are represented as a block with
  an "empty symbol" as a child. With this choice, the parse tree has no
  "null" node anywhere in the tree. However, this is not very
  satisfactory, since the empty symbol cannot exist anywhere else in
  the parse tree. Alternatives such as representing blocks as possibly
  empty sequences of items have proven even more complicated, since the
  representation of `[A,B,C]` becomes ambiguous (it could be a block
  containing three elements, or a block containing two elements, one
  of them being an infix, or any other combination), and proved more
  difficult to process in a generic way.

* Finding a more efficient representation for large sequences of items.
  Currently, they are represented by an unbalanced tree, i.e. a tree
  where one side is disproportionately larger than the other.
  So far, attempts at finding a better representation all had at
  least one severe drawback that precluded their use.
====

=== Leaf nodes

The ((leaf node))s in XL each have a uniquely identifable syntax.
For example, simply by looking at the sequence of characters, we can
tell that `42` is a whole number, `3.5` is a fractional number, `"ABC"`
is a text value, `'a'` is a character value, `ABC` is a name, and `+->+`
is an operator. This section describes the syntax for leaf nodes.

NOTE: There is currently no provision in the compiler to add new kinds
of leaf nodes. This is being considered, and would require a minimal
addition to the syntax file. The primary implementation issue is that
it would require the syntax of the syntax file to diverge from the XL
syntax itself, since numbers or names in the syntax file have to be
"hardcoded" somehow

==== Numbers

Numbers in XL begin with a ((digit)), i.e. one of `0123456789`, possibly
followed by other digits. For example, `0` and `42` are valid XL
numbers. XL describes two kinds of numbers: _((whole number))s_, which
have no fractional part, and _((fractional number))s_, which have a
fractional part.

NOTE: In the rest of the document, other terminologies, such as
_integer_ or _real_ numbers may be applied for whole numbers and
fractional numnbers respectively. This corresponds to numbers having
been given a link:#types[type] for ((evaluation)) purpose. This is notably
the case whenever a computer font is used, e.g. when we refer to
`integer` or `real` values. Except as far as syntax is concerned, this
document will very rarely talk about whole numbers or fractional
numbers.

A single ((underscore)) `+_+` character can be used to separate
digits, as in `1_000_000`, in order to increase readability. The
following are not valid XL numbers: `+_1+` (leading underscore),
`+2_+` (trailing underscore), `+3__0+` (two underscores). While this
is not a requirement, it is considered good style to group digits in
equal-sized chunks, for example `1_000_000` or `04_92_98_05_55`.

By default, numbers are written in ((base)) 10. Any other ((numerical
base)) between 2 and 36 can be used, as well as base 64 using a
special syntax. Based numbers can be written by following the base
with the `#` sign. For example `8#76` is an ((octal)) representation
of `62`. For bases between 11 and 36, letters `A` through `Z` or `a` through
`z` represent digit values larger than 10, so that `A` is 10, `f`
is 15, `Z` is 35. Case does not matter. For example, `16#FF` and
`16#ff` are two valid ((hexadecimal)) representation of `255`.
For base 64, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64[Base64] encoding is
used, and case matters. This is mostly indended for use in link:#bits[((binary
objects))], i.e. after `bits`. For instance, `64#SGVsbG8h` is the base-64
encoding for the number with the same binary representation as the
sequence of ASCII characters in `Hello!`.

For ((fractional number))s, a dot `.` is used as ((decimal separator)),
and must separate digits. For example, `0.2` and `2.0` are valid but,
unlike in C, `.2` and `2.` are not numbers but a prefix and
postifix `.` respectively. This is necessary to avoid ambiguities.
Also, the ((standard library)) denotes link:#range[((range))s] using
an infix `..`, so `2..3` is an infix `..` with `2` and `3` as
operands, representing the range between 2 and 3.

Numbers can contain an exponent, specified by the letter `e` or
`E`. If the exponent is negative, then the number is parsed as a
fractional number. Therefore, `1e3` is integer value 1000, but `1e-3`
is the same as `0.001`. The exponent is always given in base 10, and it
indicates an exponentiation in the given base, so that `2#1e8` is
2^8^, in other words decimal value 256. For based numbers, the
exponent may be preceded by a `#` sign, which is mandatory if `e` or
`E` are valid digits in the base, as in `16#FF#e2` which is an
hexadecimal representation of decimal value 65280.

There is an implementation-dependent limit for the maximum value a
number can have. This limit cannot be less than 2^64^-1 for
whole numbers, and less than `9.99e99` for floating-point numbers.

If a value is preceded by a `+` or `-` sign, that sign is parsed as a
prefix operator and not as part of the number. For example, `-2` is a
prefix `-` with `2` as an argument.

The various syntactic possibilities for XL numbers are only for
convenience, and are all strictly equivalent as far as program execution
is concerned. In other words, a program may not behave differently if a
constant is spelled as `16#FF_FF` or as `65535`.

WARNING: One unsatisfactory aspect of XL number syntax is that it does not
offer an obvious path to correctly represent "semantic" version
numbers in the code. For example, a notation like `2.3.1` will parse as
an infix `.` between real number `2.3` and integer `1`, making it
indistinguishable from `2.30.1`.

[NOTE]
====
Computers cannot really represent mathematical numbers. For
example, the set of natural numbers is infinite, so there is no such
thing as "the largest natural number". Due to hardware limitations,
there is however such a thing as the largest 64-bit unsigned number.
Similarly, there is no way to accurately represent real numbers in a
computer, but there are at least two widely used representations
called
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point[floating-point] and
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic[fixed-point].

From a link:#concept-programming[concept programming] point of view,
this is a blatant case of link:#concept-cast[concept cast]. A computer
`integer` is not a mathematical _integer_, and a computer `real` is
only a floating-point or fixed-point approximation of a true _real
number_. In the rest of this document, we will ignore this
distinction, and refer to a `real`, knowing full well that there is a
"largest" `real` value and a limited number of digits.
====

==== Symbols

Names in XL begin with an letter, followed by letters or digits. For
example, `MyName` and `A22` are valid XL names.  A single underscore
`_` can be used to separate two valid characters in a name. Therefore,
`A_2` is a valid XL name, but `A__2` and `_A` are not.

WARNING: The current implementation reads its input in Unicode UTF-8
format, and makes crude attempts at accepting Unicode. This was good
enough for Tao3D to deal with multi-lingual text, including in languages
such as Hebrew or Arabic. However, that implementation is a bit naive
with respect to distinguishing  Unicode letters from non-letter characters.
For example, `𝝿_2` or `étalon` are valid XL names, and this is intentional,
but `⇒A2` is presently a valid XL name, and this is considered a bug.

Case and delimiters are not significant in XL, so that `JOE_DALTON` and
`JoeDalton` are treated identically.

WARNING: For historical reasons, the current implementations are quite
lacking in that respect, and will treat `V` and `v` differently. There
is still an open debate about giving a semantic role to capitalization.

Operators begin with one of the ASCII punctuation characters:

....
! # $ % & ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~
....

Operators longer than one character must be specified in the XL syntax
file. For example, the XL syntax file defines a `+<=+` operator, but no
`+<=>+` operator. Consequently, the sequence `+1 <=> 2+` will be parsed as
`+(1 <= (> 2))+`. In order to add this operator, it is necessary to
link:#extending-the-syntax[extend the syntax] using a `syntax`
statement.

Names and operators are treated interchangeably by XL after the parsing
phase, and are collectively called _symbols_.

==== Text

Text(((text))) in XL is delimited with a pair of single(((single quote)))
or ((double quotes))(((quote))). Text can contain any ((printable character)).
For example, `"Hello World"` or `'ABC'` are valid text in XL. If the
delimiter is needed in the text, it can be obtained by doubling
it. For example, `"He said ""Hello"""` is text containing `He said
"Hello"`.

Additionally, the XL link:#syntax-file[((syntax file))] can specify
((delimiter))s for "long" text. Long text can include
((line-terminating characters)), and only terminates when the matching
delimiter is reached. By default, `<<` and `>>` are long-text
delimiters, so that the following is valid text:

[source]
----
MyLongText is <<
   This is a multi-line text
   that contains several lines
>>
----

Additional delimiters(((delimiter,text))) can be configured, and can
be used to define specific types of text. For example, a program that
often has to manipulate ((HTML)) data could allow `HTML` and
`END_HTML` as delimiters, so that you could write:

[source]
----
MyHTML is HTML
    <p>This is some HTML text here</p>
END_HTML
----

NOTE: *RATIONALE* The reason for a built-in format for text using
single or double quotes is because the link:#syntax-file[syntax file]
is read using the standard XL parser, and it needs text tokens in some
specific cases that would otherwise parse incorrectly such as block or
comment delimiters.

=== Inner nodes

The ((inner nodes)) are defined by the link:#syntax-file[((syntax file))],
which specifies their precedence and associativity.

==== [[indentation]]Indentation and off-side rule

Indentation(((indentation))) in XL is significant. XL follows the
_((off-side rule))_ to define program blocks. There is no need for
keywords such as `begin` and `end`, nor for block delimiters such as
`{` or `}`. However, `{` and `}` can be used as block
delimiters(((delimiter,block))) when needed, for example to create a
block on a single line. The code below shows two equivalent ways to
write the same loop:

[source]
----
loop { Eat; Pray; Love }
loop
    Eat
    Pray
    Love
----

The two ways to write the loop above are not just functionally equivalent.
They also share the same parse tree structure, the only difference
being the operators being used. For example, `A;B` is an infix `;`
with `A` on the left and `B` on the right, whereas individual lines
are operands of an infix _new-line_ operator. Similarly, `{A}` is a
block containing `A`, and indentation is represented in the parse tree
by a block delimited by _indent_ and _outdent_ invisible symbols.

The structure of the second loop from the previous listing can be
shown by the XL compiler using the `-show` option, as illustrated
below:

[source,shell]
----
% xl -parse loop.xl -style debug -show
(prefix
 loop
 (block indent
  (infix CR
   Eat
   (infix CR
    Pray
    Love
   ))))
----

Indentation must use the same ((indentation character)) within a
single file, either ((tab)) or ((space)). In other words, either your
whole file is indented with tabs, or it is indented with spaces, but
it is a ((syntax error)) to mix both.

Indentation within a block must be consistent. For example, the
following code will cause a syntax error because of the incorrect
indentation of `Pray`:

[source]
----
loop
    Eat
   Pray
    Love
----


==== [[syntax-file]]Operator precedence and associativity

The operators available for XL programmers are defined by the
link:{xl}src/xl.syntax[syntax file]. The same rules apply for all
symbols, i.e. for names or for operators. The table given in this file
uses keywords such as `INFIX`, `PREFIX` and `POSTFIX` to indicate if
an operator is an infix, a prefix, or a postfix respectively.

The table also gives operators a precedence. For example, the following
segment in the `INFIX` portion of the table indicates that `*` and `/`
have higher precedence than `+` and `-`, so that `X+Y*Z` will parse as
`X+(Y*Z)`:

[source]
----
        21      -> is has
        310     + -
        320     * / mod rem
----

The precedence also indicates associativity for infix operators. Even
precedences indicate left associativity, as for `+` and `*` above. This
means that `X * Y * Z` parses as `(X * Y) * Z`. Conversely,
right-associativity is indicated by an odd precedence, as is the case
for `is`. This means that `X is Y is Z` parses as `X is (Y is Z)`.

Enforcing different precedences for left and right associativity
guarantees that it’s impossible for operators to have the same
precedence, with some being left-associative and some being
right-associative, which would cause parsing ambiguities.

The syntax file uses a few special names:

* `INFIX`, `PREFIX`, `POSTFIX` and `BLOCK` introduce sections that
  declare the operators of the respective types.
* `COMMENT` and `TEXT` specify delimiters for comments and long text
  respectively.
* `SYNTAX` introduces a child syntax. It is followed by the name of a
  syntax file, and then by an opening and closing symbol for that syntax.
* `BINARY` specifies the names that introduce binary data. The default
  syntax file uses `bits`. The syntax for binary data can take one of two
  forms: either a very large integer constant in big-endian format, as in
  `bits 16#000102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F`, or the name of a file, as in
  `bits "image.png"`.
* `NEWLINE` is used to represent the infix operators that separates
  individual source code lines.
* `STATEMENT` is the precedence that delimits
  link:#expression-vs-statement[expressions from statements]. Any
  operator with a lower precedence belongs to a statement, like `if` or
  `loop`. Any operator with a higher precedence belongs to an expression,
  like `+` or `*`.
* `DEFAULT` is the default precedence for names and symbols. It is not
  very important in practice.
* `FUNCTION` is the precedence for names and symbols used as a prefix
  when they are not explicitly listed in the file. If you write `sin X`
  for example, the associated precedence will be that of `FUNCTION`.

==== Delimiters

Additional sections of the syntax file define delimiters for comment,
block and text. Comment and text delimiters come in pairs.

The default syntax file specifies comments that follow the C/{cpp}
convention, i.e. comments either start with `+/*+` and end with `+*/+` or
start with `//` and end with a new line. The basic text separators
(simple and double quotes) are not specified in the syntax file
because they are used to parse the syntax file itself. The default
syntax file adds `<<` and `>>` as separators for multi-line text..

Block separators come in pairs and have a priority. The special names
`INDENT` and `UNINDENT` are used for the indentation block. The block
priority is used to give the priority of the block in an expression, but
also to determine if the block contains an expression or a statement.

In the default syntax file, indentation blocks and blocks delimited by
curly braces `{ }` contain statements, whereas blocks delimited by
parentheses `( )` or square brackets `[ ]` will contain expressions.

==== Child syntax

A syntax file can define a child syntax file, which overrides the syntax
when a given symbol is found.

The link:{xl}src/xl.syntax[default syntax file] contains a
link:{xl}src/C.syntax[child syntax] named `C` which is activated between
the `extern` name and a following semi-colon `;`. This is used to
approximate C-style parsing for extern declarations, making it easier to
reference C code from XL:

[source]
----
extern real sqrt(real);
----

NOTE: The so-called "C syntax" in XL is only a very crude and limited
approximation of the actual C syntax, which is only intended for
relatively simple function declarations.

==== [[syntax-statements]]Extending the syntax

The `syntax` name followed by a block can be used to alter the default
syntax provided by the link:{xl}src/xl.syntax[syntax file]. Within the
block, operators can be defined and their precedence given using the
link:#operator-precedence-and-associativity[same rules] as in the syntax
file.

For example, if you want to add the spaceship operator `+<=>+` in your
program, and give the same precedence as `+<=+`, namely 290, you could
write:

[source]
----
syntax
    INFIX 290 <=>
----

NOTE: Extending the syntax is intended to also work also in a module.
This means that an `use` statement can alter the syntax in your source
code. This is, however, rarely recommended. Also, importing a syntax
extension does not presently work.

=== Making the syntax easy for humans

XL contains a couple of tweaks designed specifically to make code easier
to read or write by humans. When the human logic is subtle, so is the XL
compiler parsing…

==== Expression vs. statement

This first tweak is intended to put in XL an implicit grammatical
grouping that humans apparently do. Consider for example the following:

[source]
----
print sin X, cos Y
----

Most human beings parse this as `print (sin(X),cos(Y))`, i.e. we call
`print` with two values resulting from evaluating `sin X` and `cos Y`.

This is, however, not entirely logical. If `print` takes comma-separated
arguments, why wouldn’t `sin` also take comma-separated arguments? In
other words, why doesn’t this parse as `print(sin(X, cos(Y))`?

This shows that humans have a notion of _expressions_ vs. _statements_.
Expressions such as `sin X` have higher priority than commas and require
parentheses if you want multiple arguments. By contrast, statements such
as `print` have lower priority, and will take comma-separated argument
lists. An indent or `{ }` block begins a statement, whereas parentheses
`()` or square brackets `[]` begin an expression.

There are rare cases where the default rule will not achieve the desired
objective, and you will need additional parentheses. One important such
case is what follow `is` if it is not a block. Consider the following
declarations:

[source]
----
debug X     is write "X=", X
expm1 X     is exp X - 1
double X    is X; X
----

The first example parses as intended, as a statement. The second one,
however, is not, despite being syntactically similar. On could want to
see this parse as `(exp X) -1`, but in reality, it parses as `exp (X-1)`
for the same reason that the line above parses as `write ("X=", X)`.
Another issue occurs with the body of `double X`, because it actually
only contains the first `X`. The `;` operator has lower precedence
than `is`, which is useful for link:#scoping[maps], but does not
achieve the expected effect above.

The solution to these problems is use a block on the right of `is` in
all these cases. The correct way to write the above code is therefore:

[source]
----
debug X     is { write "X=", X } <1>
expm1 X     is ( exp X - 1 )  <2>
double X    is { X; X } <3>
----
<1> The curly braces indicate that we expect `write` to be a statement.
<2> The parentheses indicate that we expect `exp` to be an expression.
<3> The curly braces ensure that we interpret the sequence as the body
    of `double X`.

NOTE: A quality implementation of XL should probably warn if a prefix
is seen on the right of `is` and has an infix as an
argument. Expressions such as `type X` or `foo(A,B,C)` do not present
a risk, but expressions such as `foo A-1` do represent present a risk,
and should always be written in a block.

==== infix vs. prefix

Another special rule is that XL will use the presence of a space on only
one side of an operator to disambiguate between an infix or a prefix.
For example:

[source]
----
write -A    // write (-A)
B - A       // (B - A)
----

== [[evaluation]]XL program evaluation

XL defines _((program execution))_ primarily in terms of operations on the
parse tree combined with operations on an implicit _((context))_ that stores
the program state. The context itself is also described in XL in order
to define the expected result of ((evaluation)).

For efficiency, actual implementations are unlikely to store everything
as an actual parse tree, although there is an _interpreter_
implementation that does exactly that. A compiler is more likely to
link:#compiled-representations[optimize representations] of both code
and data, as long as that optimized representation ultimately respect
the semantics described using the normal form for the parse tree.

=== Execution phases

Executing an XL program is the result of three phases,

[arabic]
. A link:#parsing-phase[parsing phase] where program source text is
  converted to a parse tree,
. A link:#declaration-phase[declaration phase], where all declarations
  are stored in the context,
. An link:#evaluation-phase[evaluation phase], where statements other
  than declarations are processed in order.

The execution phases are designed so that in a very large number of
cases, it is at least conceptually possible to do both the parsing and
declaration phases ahead of time, and to generate machine code that can
perform the evaluation phase using only representations of code and data
link:#compiled-representations[optimized] for the specific machine
running the program. It should be possible to create an efficient
ahead-of-time compiler for XL. Work is currently in progress to build
one.

NOTE: Reasonably efficient compilers were produced for earlier
generations of the language, notably as part of the Tao3D project.
However, this earlier iteration of the language had a very weak type
system that made advanced optimizations hard to achieve. This was
actually a feature for Tao3D, which purposely disabled some
optimizations in order to improve compilation speed, notably when the
program structure did not change. The version of XL described in this
document, however, has markedly evolved relative to what was implemented
in Tao3D, with the hope that much better code quality can be achieved.
This part has not been demonstrated yet.

==== Execution context

The execution of XL programs is defined by describing the evolution of a
particular data structure called the _execution context_, or simply
_context_, which stores all values accessible to the program at any
given time.

That data structure is only intended to explain the effect of evaluating
the program. It is not intended to be a model of how things are actually
implemented. As a matter of fact, care was taken in the design of XL to
allow standard compilation and optimization techniques to remain
applicable, and to leave a lot of freedom regarding actual evaluation
techniques(((evaluation,technique))).

In the examples below, `CONTEXT0`, `CONTEXT1`, … will denote
pseudo-variables that describe the various currently visible execution
contexts, following the language link:#scoping[scoping] rules. The most
recent contexts will have higher numbers. In addition, `HIDDEN0`,
`HIDDEN1`, … will represent pending execution contexts that are
invisible to the currently executing code. These are also known as
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_record[_activation records_].
Entries in `HIDDEN` contexts are
link:#lifetime[live], but invisible to the current
code. By convention, `CONTEXT0` and `HIDDEN0` are not defined in the
examples and are assumed to be inherited from earlier execution.

==== Parsing phase

The parsing phase reads source text and turns it into a parse tree using
operator spelling and precedence information given in the
link:{xl}src/xl.syntax[syntax file]. This results either in a parse-time
error, or in a faithful representation of the source code as a parse
tree data structure that can be used for program evaluation.

Since there is almost a complete equivalence between the parse tree and
the source code, the rest of the document will, for convenience,
represent a parse tree using a source code form. In the rare cases where
additional information is necessary for understanding, it will be
provided in the form of XL comments.

Beyond the creation of the parse tree, very little actual processing
happens during parsing. There are, however, a few tasks that can only be
performed during parsing:

[arabic]
. Filtering out comments: Comments should not have an effect on the
program, so they are simply eliminated during parsing.
. Processing `syntax` statements: This must be done during parsing,
because `syntax` is designed to modify the
link:#extending-the-syntax[spelling and precedence]
of operators, and that information is used during the parsing phase.
. Processing `use` statements: Since imported modules can contain
`syntax` statements, they must at least partially be processed during
parsing. Details about `use` statements are covered in the
link:#modules[chapter about modules].
. Identifying words that switch to a
link:#child-syntax[child syntax]: symbols that
activate a child syntax are recognized during parsing. This is the case
for example with the `extern` name in the
link:{xl}src/xl.syntax#L62[default syntax].
. Identifying binary data: words such as `bits` marked as introducing
`BINARY` data in the syntax file are treated specially during parsing,
to generate parse tree nodes representing binary data. > NOTE: this is
not currently implemented.

The need to process `use` statements during parsing means that it’s not
possible in XL to have computed `use` statements. The name of the module
must always be evaluated at compile-time.

NOTE: *RATIONALE* An alternative would have been to allow computed `use`
statement, but disallow `syntax` in them. However, for convenience,
`use` names look like `XL.CONSOLE.TEXT_IO` and not, say,
`"xl/console/text_io.xs"`, so there is no obvious way to compute them
anyway. If computed `use` statement ever become necessary, it will be
easy enough to use the syntax `use "path"` for them.

Once ((parsing)) completes successfully, the parse tree can be handed to the
((declaration)) and ((evaluation)) phases. Parsing occurs for the _entire
program_, including imported modules, before the other phases begin.

==== Sequences

Both declaration and evaluation phases will process _sequences_, which
are one of:

* A block, in which case processing the sequence means processing the
block’s child
+
[source]
----
loop { print "Hello World" }
----
* An infix `NEWLINE`, semi-colon `;` or comma `,`, in which case the
left and right operands of the infix are processed in that order.
The comma is typically used in parameter lists and to separate
expressions, whereas the semi-colon and new-line are used to separate
statements. Processing the infix as a sequence only happens if
link:#pattern-matching[pattern matching] did not succeed with the
infix form.
+
[source]
----
print "One"; print "Two"
print "Three"
----
* An `use` statement, which is the only statement that requires
processing in all three executation phases.
+
[source]
----
use XL.MATH.COMPLEX
----
* A `syntax` definition, which only plays a role during parsing is
ignored during the declaration and evaluation phases.
+
[source]
----
syntax { INFIX 290 <=> }
----
* An infix `is`, which is called a _definition_, an infix `:` or `as`,
which are called link:#type-annotations[_type annotations_], or an
infix assignment operator `:=` with a `:` type annotation on the left,
called a _variable initialization_. Definitions, type annotations and
variable initializations are collectively called _declarations_, and
are processed during the link:#declaration-phase[declaration phase].
+
[source]
----
pi is 3.1415                  // Definition of 'pi'
e as real is 2.71828          // Typed definition of 'e'
Count : integer               // Variable declaration of 'Count'
byte_size X as integer        // Function declaration of 'byte_size X'
Remaining : integer := 100    // Variable initialization of 'Remaining'
----
* Anything else, which is called a _statement_ and is processed during
the link:#evaluation-phase[evaluation phase].
+
[source]
----
print "This is a statement"
----

For example, consider the following code:

[source]
----
pi is 3.14
circumference 5.3
circumference Radius:real is 2 * pi * Radius
----

The first and last line are representing a definition of `pi` and
`circumference Radius:real` respectively. The second line is made of one
statement that computes `circumference 5.3`. There are two definitions,
one statement and no type annotation in this code.

Note that there is a type annotation for `Radius` in the definition on
the last line, but that annotation is _local_ to the definition, and
consequently not part of the declarations in the top-level sequence.

In that specific case, that type annotation is a declaration of a
_parameter_ called `Radius`, which only accepts `real` values.
Sometimes, such parameters are called _formal parameters_. A parameter
will receive its value from an _argument_ during the evaluation. For
example the `Radius` parameter will be _bound_ to argument `5.3` while
evaluating the statement on the second line.

The _result_ of a sequence is the value of its last statement. In our
example, the result of executing the code will be the value computed by
`circumference 5.3`.

==== Declaration phase

The declaration phase of the program begins as soon as the parsing phase
finishes.

During the declaration phase, all declarations are stored in order in
the context, so that they appear before any declaration that was already
in the context. As a result, the new declarations may _shadow_ existing
declarations that match(((declaration,shadowing)).

In the example above, the declaration phase would result in a context
that looks something like:

[source]
----
CONTEXT1 is
    pi is 3.14
    circumference Radius:real is 2 * pi * Radius
    CONTEXT0
    HIDDEN0
----

An actual implementation is likely to store declarations is a more
efficient manner. For example, an interpreter might use some hashing or
some form of balanced tree. Such optimizations must preserve the order
of declarations, since correct behavior during the evaluation phase
depends on it.

In the case of a link:#compiling-xl[compiled implementation], the
compiler will most likely assign machine locations to each of the
declarations. When the program runs, a constant like `pi` or the
definition of `circumference` may end up being represented as a
machine address, and a variable such as `Radius` may be represented as
a "stack location", i.e. a preallocated offset from the current stack
pointer, the corresponding memory location only containing the value,
i.e. the right-hand side of `:=`. Most of the
link:#types[type analysis] can be performed at compile
time, meaning that most type information is unnecessary at program run
time and can be eliminated from the compiled program.

Note that since the declaration phase occurs before the execution phase,
all declarations in the program will be visible during the evaluation
phase. In our example, it is possible to use `circumference` before it
has been declared. Definitions may therefore refer to one another in a
circular way. Some other languages such as C require "forward
declarations" in such cases, XL does not.

The parse tree on the left of `is`, `as` or `:` is called the _pattern_
of the declaration. The pattern will be checked against the _form_ of
parse trees to be evaluated. The right operand of `:` or `as` is the
type of the type annotation. The parse tree on the right of `is` is
called the _body_ of the definition.

==== Evaluation phase

The evaluation phase processes each statement in the order they appear
in the program. For each statement, the context is looked up for
matching declarations in order. There is a match if the shape of the
tree being evaluated matches the pattern of the declaration. Precise
pattern matching rules will be link:#pattern-matching[detailed below].
In our example, `circumference 5.3` will not match the declaration of
`pi`, but it will match the declaration of `circumference Radius:real`
since the value `5.3` is indeed a real number.

When a match happens, a new context is created with definitions that
_bind_ formal parameters to the corresponding argument. Such
definitions are, unsurprisingly, called _((bindings))_.
This new context is called a _local context_ and will be used to
evaluate the body of the definition. For example, the local context
for `circumference Radius:real` would be:

[source]
----
CONTEXT2 is
    Radius:real := 5.3
    CONTEXT1
    HIDDEN1
HIDDEN1 is CONTEXT1
----

As a reminder, `Radius` is a _formal parameter_, or simply _parameter_
that receives the _argument_ 5.3 as a result of _binding_. The binding
remains active for the duration of the evaluation of of the body of the
definition. The binding, at least conceptually, contains the type
annotation for the formal parameter, ensuring that all required
link:#types[type constraints] are known and respected. For
example, the context contains the `Redius:real` annotation, so that
attempting `Radius := "Hello"` in the body of `circumference` would
fail, because the type of `"Hello"` does not match the `real` type.

Bindings can be marked as link:#mutability[mutable] or constant. In
this document, bindings made with `:=` are mutable, while binding made
with `is` are constant. Since by default, an `X : T` annotation
creates a mutable binding, the binding for `Radius` is made with `:=`.

Once the new context has been created, execution of the program
continues with the body of the definition. In that case, that means
evaluating expression `2 * pi * Radius` in the newly created local
context.

After execution of the body completes, the result of that execution
replaces the statement that matched the definition’s pattern. In our
example, `circumference 5.3` behaves like `2 * pi * Radius` in a context
containing `Radius is 5.3`.

The process can then resume with the next statement if there is one. In
our example, there isn’t one, so the execution is complete.

=== Expression evaluation

Executing the body for the definition of `circumference Radius:real`
involves the evaluation of expression `2 * pi * Radius`. This follows
almost exactly the same process as for `circumference 5.3`, but in that
case, that process needs to be repeated multiple times to complete the
evaluation.

If we apply the evaluation process with `2 * pi * Radius`, assuming the
declarations in the link:#standard-library[((standard library))], no
declaration has a larger pattern like `X * Y * Z` that could match the
whole expression. However, there is a definition for a multiplication
between `real` numbers, with a pattern that looks like `X:real *
Y:real as real`, as well as another for `integer` multiplication, with
a pattern that looks like `X:integer * Y:integer`.  There may be more,
but we will ignore them for the rest of this discussion. The code
below shows what the relevant declaration might look like (`...`
indicates irrelevant code):

[source]
----
X:integer * Y:integer   as integer  is ...
X:real * Y:real         as real     is ...
----

The `*` operator is left-associative, so `2 * pi * Radius` parses as
`(2 * pi) * Radius`. Therefore, we will be looking for a match with `X`
corresponding to `2 * pi` and `Y` corresponding to `Radius`. However,
that information alone is insufficient to determine if either
sub-expression is `integer` or `real`. In order to be able to make that
determination, link:#immediate-evaluation[immediate evaluation] of the
arguments is required. The evaluation process therefore repeats with
sub-expression `2 * pi`, and like before, it is necessary to evaluate
`pi`. This in turns gives the result `3.14` given the current context.
That result replaces `pi`, so that we now must evaluate `2 * 3.14`.

The `2 * 3.14` tree does not match `X:real * Y:real` because `2` is an
`integer` and not a `real`. It does not match `X:integer * Y:integer`
either because `3.14` is a `real` and not an `integer`. However, the
((standard library)) provides a definition of an _((implicit conversion))_
that looks something like this:

[source]
----
X:integer as real     is builtin IntegerToReal
----

This implicit conversion tells the compiler how to transform an
`integer` value like `2` into a `real`. Implicit conversions are only
considered if there is no exact match, and only one of them can be used
to match a given parameter. In our case, there isn’t an exact match, so
the evaluation will consider the implicit conversion to get a `real`
from `integer` value `2`.

The body of the implicit conversion above is therefore evaluated in a
context where `X` is set to `2`:

[source]
----
CONTEXT3 is
    X:integer := 2
    CONTEXT2
    HIDDEN2
HIDDEN2 is CONTEXT2
----

The result of that implicit conversion is `2.0`. Evaluation can then
resume with the `X:real * Y:real as real` definition, this time called
with an argument of the correct `real` type for `X`:

[source]
----
CONTEXT4 is
    X:real := 2.0
    Y:real := 3.14
    CONTEXT2
    HIDDEN2
----

The result of the multiplication is a `real` with value `6.28`, and
after evaluating `Radius`, evaluation of the second multiplication will
then happen with the following context:

[source]
----
CONTEXT5 is
    X:real := 6.28 // from 2 * pi
    Y:real :=5.3  // from Radius
    CONTEXT2
    HIDDEN2
----

The result of the last multiplication is a `real` with value `33.284`.
This is the result of evaluating `circumference 5.3`, and consequently
the result of executing the entire program.

NOTE: The link:#standard-library[standard XL library] only provides
implicit conversions that do not cause data loss. On most
implementation, `real` has a 53-bit mantissa, which means that the
implicit conversion from `integer` to `real` actually needs to check
the converted value in a platform-dependent way:

[source]
----
X:integer as real when X >= -2^53 and X < 2^53 is ...
----

=== Syntactic sugar

A number of special forms can be used to make declaration or
definition easier to read, write or validate. This is called
_((syntactic sugar))_. The primary intent of syntactic sugar is to
help the programmer understand what the code means. However, syntactic
sugar also gives additional hints to the compiler, and may suggest one
implementation over another. Syntactic sugar is specified by reference
to a functionally equivalent _raw_ version of the same code.

A few names are reserved for use as syntactic sugar prefix. These
names have a very low precedence, and as a result do not significantly
impact the syntax of the pattern of the declaration they apply to.
These sugar names are `type`, `class`, `module`, `function`, `method`,
`procedure`, `to`, `operation`, `data`, `in`, `out`, `inout`, `io`,
`constant`, `variable`, `macro`, `generic`, `polymorphic`, `fast`,
`small`, `global`, `thread` and `static`. Proper use of these names
also makes textual search of the declarations or definitions easier.

The rest of this document will preferably use the sugared form.

CAUTION: The evaluation rules are never changed by using syntactic
sugar. The result of evaluation with or without syntactic sugar should
be identical. Syntactic sugar may guide the implementation in picking
the best implementation to achieve that result. It may also allow the
implementation to emit more precise diagnostics.

==== Types sugar

The `type` prefix can be used to announce a type, which implicitly
indicates that the form has the `type` type:

[source]
----
type pair[T:type] is matching pair(First:T, Second:T)           // Sugared
pair[T:type] as type is matching pair(First:T, Second:T)        // Raw
----

There is also a syntactic sugar for the common case where the definition
of the type is a `matching` form. In that case, `is matching` can be
replaced with `matches`:

[source]
----
type pair[T:type] matches pair(First:T, Second:T)               // Sugared
pair[T:type] as type is matching pair(First:T, Second:T)        // Raw
----

This syntactic sugar also applies to the link:#interface[interface]
of a type, including the definition of its features or of the types it
inherits from:

[source]
----
type pair[T:type] with                                          // Sugared
   First  : T
   Second : T
pair[T:type] as type with                                       // Raw
   First  : T
   Second : T

type rectangle like shape                                       // Sugared
type rectangle inherits shape                                   // Sugared
rectangle as type like shape                                    // Raw

type point like shape with (X:coordinate; Y:coordinate)         // Sugared
point as type like shape with (X:coordinate; Y:coordinate)      // Raw
----

Finally, the word `class` is a syntactic sugar for `type`, which can
be used for type hierarchies intended to support
link:#object-oriended-programming[object-oriended programming]:

[source]
----
class circle inherits shape with
   X       : coordinate
   Y       : coordinate
   Radius  : length
----

Using syntactic sugar for types gives the compiler additional hints
that the form is intended to be used as a type in type
annotations. This can be used by the compiler to:

* Accelerate type lookup in type annotations, by focusing on types
* Treat the form as a compile-time constant
* Use the form at compile-time for type analysis
* Emit more precise diagnostics


==== Modules sugar

The syntactic sugar for link:#modules[modules] is very similar in its
syntax to that of types:

[source]
----
module M with Interface                 // Sugared
M as module with Interface              // Raw

module M is Implementation              // Sugared
M as module is Implementation           // Raw
----

The `module` syntactic sugar gives hints to the compiler that the
declaration is used as a module. The compiler can use that information
to:

* Accelerate module lookup and build dependencies
* Validate module version numbers
* Verify ABI stability and compatibility
* Optimize the code for use in a shared library
* Emit better diagnostics


==== Parameter sugar

The `in`, `out` and `inout` have a syntactic sugar, where they can be
placed before a type annotation or a pattern, instead of just before
the type in the type annotation.

[source]
----
to Copy(out Target:value, in From:value)                // Sugared
Copy(Target:out value, From:in value) as mayfail        // Raw
----

This sugar can also be used without a type, in which case the type is
assumed to be `anything`:

[source]
----
to Debug(in Thing) is print "Debug: ", Thing                    // Sugared
Debug(Thing:in anything) as mayfail is print "Debug: ", Thing   // Raw
----


==== Sugar for code and data

Some syntactic sugar can be used to indicate if a form is a `procedure`,
a `method`, a `function`, an `operation` or if it represents
`data`, a `property` or an `attribute`. Like other kinds of syntactic
sugar, the primary intent is to make the code easier to read.

[source]
----
// Interface
procedure Initialization
to Reset(Devices:devices)
function Sin(X:real) as real
method Width(S:shape) as length // aka S.width
type shape with
    method Height as length
    property Foreground : color
    attribute Background : color
operation Value in Low..High as boolean
data X, Y as infix

// Implementation
procedure Initialization is { Zero Memory; Reset AllDevices }
to Reset(Devices:devices) is { for D in Devices loop Reset D }
function Sin(X:real) as real is Cos(pi/2 - X)
method Width(S:shape) as length is S.right - S.left // aka S.Width
type shape is
    method Height as length is top - bottom
    property Foreground : color
    bg : color
    attribute Background : color is
        get   is bg
        set C is bg := C
operation Value in Low..High as boolean is Value >= Low and Value <= High
data X, Y as infix is self
----

While these sugared forms are optional, they may make the code more
readable, shorter or more precise. In addition, they convey additional
additional information to the compiler or to a person reading the code:

* `procedure` is typically used for definitions that do not return a
  value. If no result type is specified for the pattern, then `mayfail` is
  implied (that is `nil or error`), and diagnostics will be emitted
  accordingly. A result type can also be explicitly given. In that
  case, using `procedure` is a hint to the compiler that the
  implementation is expected to have side effects, as opposed to
  `function`.

* `to` is a shorter form of `procedure` that is normally used for
  patterns that look like English verbs. For example, `procedure Write`
  can be written as `to Write`.

* `function` indicates that the operation behaves like a pure
  mathematical function, i.e. it has no side effects and returns the
  same value for identical inputs. This allows the compiler to explore
  additional optimizations, and emit additional diagnostics if the
  implementation has side effects.

* `method` indicates that the pattern applies to an object, its first
  formal parameter, and for prefix methods, it provides a dot notation
  `Object.Method` for calling the method.  For example, the `Width` method
  defined above can also be invoked as `S.Width`.

* `property` and `attribute` are shorthand ways to specify
  link:#attribute[attribute] features in a type, i.e. features that
  behave like a field, but can be implemented in a different way. The
  language does not make a distinction between attributes and
  properties, but a special project may give them different meaning,
  for example in a drawing program, that attributes have a
  user-visible interface whereas properties are internal values.

* `operation` is a marker when reading the code for special notations.
  It is intended to draw the attention of the reader on some special
  form that he may not be used to.

* `data` is a marker indicating that the notation is used primarily
  for data. For example, the notation `data X,Y` indicates that there
  is no actual operation associated to the `,` infix operator,
  i.e. that `1,3,5,8,4` should be representable using only data as
  opposed to code. The implementation of a `data` normally uses
  link:#self[`self`].

==== Implementations hints

Prefix names such as `constant`, `variable`, `macro`, `generic`,
`polymorphic`, `fast` and `small` tell the compiler what is the intended
usage for the definition. They may guide the compiler into favoring
one possible implementation over another.

For example, consider a parameter-less name like `seconds`. This could
be a variable holding a duration in seconds, a constant indicating the
number of seconds in an hour, an operation that returns the seconds in
the current time, or a function that computes the number of seconds
our universe will last, which is a very lengthy computation that
always returns the same value. This would best be indicated by
using different syntactic sugar for the declaration of `seconds`:

....
variable  seconds as natural    // Variable storing a duration in seconds
constant  seconds as natural    // Number of seconds in an hour
operation seconds as natural    // Seconds in the current time
function  seconds as natural    // Estimate number of seconds in the universe
....

The meaning of these words is intended as follows, and a compiler is
free to emit a diagnostic if one of the conditions is not met:

* `constant` indicates that the declaration should be implementable as a
  compile-time constant that can be stored in a read-only area of memory.

* `variable` indicates that the declaration should be implementable
  as a variable in a writable area of memory.

* `macro` indicates that the declaration should be implemented using
  compile-time manipulations of parse tree arguments, and that the
  compiler should not spend too much time trying to analyze the type
  of the parameters while processing the definition.

* `generic` indicates that the declaration is intended to be
  parameterized at compile-time, in order to generate multiple
  _((instantiation))s_, and that type analysis on each instantiation
  at compile-time will provide valuable information.

* `polymorphic` indicates that the declaration is intended to be
  parameterized at run-time, and that a single implementation should
  be generated that can deal with a multiplicity of types using
  dynamic dispatch.

* `fast` indicates that the declaration should be optimized for speed,
  even at the expense of compilation time or code size. For example, a
  call to that declaration could be inlined.

* `small` indicates that the declaration should be optimized for size,
  even at the expense of execution time. For example, data could be
  packed and call inlining could be disabled.

In order to see the effect that these modifiers may have, we can
consider code that simply adds a value to itself, and see what {cpp}
feature this may be related to:

....
// Compile-time constant: constexpr
constant twice(X) is X + X

// Variable at run-time: function pointer
variable twice(X) is X + X

// Source code transformation: #define
macro twice(X) is X + X

// Instantiation based on arguments: template
generic twice(X) is X + X

// Dynamic dispatch at run-time: virtual functions
polymorphic twice(X) is X + X

// Optimize for speed: inline
fast twice(X) is X + X

// Optimize for size: pragmas, command-line options
small twice(X) is X + X
....


==== Storage hints

Three forms of syntactic sugar provide _((storage hints))_:

* `global` indicates that a definition belongs to a shared
  link:#global-context[global context].
* `static` indicates that a definition belongs to a
  link:#static-context[static context] that keeps its content between
  successive evaluations.
* `thread` indicates that a definition belongs to a
  link:#thread-context[thread context] that is associated to each
  thread of execution.

In the following example, `Counter` keeps its value from one
evaluation of `EvaluationCounter` to the next, but is not visible to
any entity outside of `EvaluationCounter`:

[source]
----
operation EvaluationCounter as natural is               // Sugared
    static Counter : natural := 0
    Counter++
EvaluationCounter as natural is                         // Raw
    static.{ Counter : natural := 0 }
    static.Counter++
----

==== Alternate notations

In some cases, it may be useful to provide several notations for the
same things. The `written` infix form can be used to specify
additional patterns for the same implementation. This may increase
readability, or help deal with properties such as commutativity.

For example, the following defines an iterative `Factorial` function,
which gives the operation a name, while also providing the familiar
`N!` notation for it:

[source]
----
function Factorial(N:natural) as natural written N! is
    result := 1
    for I in 1..N loop
        result *= I
----

The following code provides a fused multiply-add operation that is
recognized whether the multiplication is on the left or on the right:

[source]
----
function FMA(X:number, Y:number, Z:number) as number written X+Y*Z written Y*Z+X
----

=== [[pattern]]Pattern matching

As we have seen above, the key to execution in XL is _pattern matching_,
which is the process of finding the declarations patterns that match a
given parse tree. Pattern matching is recursive, the _top-level pattern_
matching only if all _sub-patterns_ also match.

For example, consider the following declaration:

[source]
----
log X:real when X > 0.0 is ...
----

This will match an expression like `log 1.25` because:

[arabic]
. `log 1.25` is a prefix with the name `log` on the left, just like the
  prefix in the pattern.
. `1.25` matches the formal parameter `X` and has the expected `real`
  type, meaning that `1.25` matches the sub-pattern `X:real`.
. The condition `X > 0.0` is true with binding `X is 1.25`

There are several kinds of patterns that will match different kinds of
expressions:

* <<Name definitions>> match whole names.
* <<Wildcards>> match arbitrary arguments.
* <<Type annotations>> match arguments based on their type.
* <<Function (prefix) definitions>> match prefix forms ("functions").
* <<Postfix definitions>> match postfix forms.
* <<Infix definitions>> match infix forms.
* <<Argument splitting>> match names bound to infix, prefix or postfix
  values to infix, prefix or postfix patterns.
* <<Conditional patterns>> match values based on arbitrary conditions
* <<Literal constants>> match constants with the same value.
* <<Metabox values>> match values computed by the comiler.
* <<Blocks>> change the priority of expressions.
* <<Scope pattern matching>> allows large lists of paraameters to be
  passed as argument ina more readable way.

==== Name definitions

Top-level name patterns only match the exact same name.

[cols="24%,38%,38%",options="header",]
|===========================================
| Declaration  | Matched by | Not matched by
| `pi is 3.14` | `pi`       | `ip`, `3.14`
|===========================================

Definitions with a top-level name pattern are called _name definitions_.

NOTE: This case only applies to names, not to operators. You cannot
define a `+` operator that way.

==== Wildcards

Name patterns that are not at the top-level can match any expression,
and this does not require link:#immediate-evaluation[immediate
evaluation]. In that case, the expression will be bound to the name in
the argument context, unless it is already bound in the current context.
In that latter case, the value `New` of the new expression is compared
with the already bound value `Old` by evaluating the `New=Old`
expression, and the pattern only matches if that check evaluates to
`true`.

[cols="24%,38%,38%",options="header",]
|==========================================================
| Declaration | Matched by              | Not matched by
| `X+Y`       | `2+"A"`                 | `2-3`, `+3`, `3+`
| `N+N`       | `3+3`, `A+B` when `A=B` | `3-3`, `3+4`
|==========================================================

Such name patterns are called _wildcard parameters_ because they can
match any expression, or _untyped parameters_ because no type checking
occurs on the matched argument.

In order to catch anything at the top-level, for example in
link:#scoping[maps], it is necessary to use the `lambda` notation:

[cols="24%,38%,38%",options="header",]
|==========================================================
| Declaration | Matched by              | Not matched by
| `\N`        | Any value               | Nothing
|==========================================================


NOTE: This case only applies to names, not to operators. You cannot
define a `+` parameter that way.

==== Type annotations

When the pattern is an infix `:` or `as`, it matches an expression if
the expression matches the pattern on the left of the infix, and if the
link:#types[type] of the expression matches the type on the
right of the infix.

A type annotation as a top-level pattern is a declaration:

[cols="24%,38%,38%",options="header",]
|=====================================================
| Top-level pattern    | Matched by | Not matched by
| `X:integer`          | `X`        | `2`, `'X'`
| `seconds as integer` | `seconds`  | `2`, `"seconds"`
|=====================================================

A type annotation as a sub-pattern declares a parameter:

[cols="24%,38%,38%",options="header",]
|==============================================================================
| Parameter pattern    | Matched by| Not matched by
| `X:integer`          | `42`      | `X` (unless bound to an `integer`)
| `seconds as integer` | `42`      |`X` (unless constant bound to an `integer`)
|==============================================================================

Such patterns are called _type annotations_, and are used to perform
type checking. Normally, type annotations using `:` are used to declare
the type of parameters, whereas `as` is used to declare the type of the
expression being defined, as shown for the pattern on the left of `is`
in the example below:

[source]
----
X:real + Y:real as real is ...
----

For readability, a type annotation for a name can also be matched by an
link:#assignment[assignment] or a link:#name-definitions[name definition]
with the same name as the formal parameter:

[source]
----
circle (Radius:real, CenterX:real, CenterY:real) as circle
C : circle := circle(Radius := 3.5, CenterX := 6.5, CenterY := 3.3)

picture is type picture
    Width  : size
    Height : size
    Buffer : buffer
P : picture is picture
    Width  is 640
    Height is 480
    Buffer is my_buffer
----

The link:#scope-pattern-matching[scope pattern matching] makes it
possible to give arguments in a different order in that case.

==== Function (prefix) definitions

When the pattern is a prefix, like `sin X`, the expression will match
only if it is a prefix with the same name, and when the pattern on the
right of the prefix matches the right operand of the expression.

[cols="24%,38%,38%",options="header",]
|=====================================================
| Pattern   | Matched by       | Not matched by
| `sin X`   | `sin (2.27 + A)` | `cos 3.27`
| `+X:real` | `+2.27`          | `+"A"`, `-3.1`, `1+1`
|=====================================================

When the prefix is a name, definitions for such patterns are called
_function definitions_, and the corresponding expressions are usually
called _function calls_. Otherwise, they are called _prefix
definitions_.

==== Postfix definitions

When the pattern is a postfix, like `X%`, the expression will match only
if it is a postfix with the same name, and when the pattern on the left
of the postfix matches the left operand of the expression.

[cols="24%,38%,38%",options="header",]
|=============================================
| Pattern | Matched by      | Not matched by
| `X%`    | `2.27%`, `"A"%` | `%3`, `3%2`
| `X km`  | `2.27 km`       | `km 3`, `1 km 3`
|=============================================

Definitions for such patterns are called _postfix definitions_, and the
corresponding expressions are usually called _postfix expressions_. The
name or operator is sometimes called the _suffix_.

==== Infix definitions

When the pattern is an infix, it matches an infix expression with the
same infix operator when both the left and right operands of the
pattern match the corresponding left and right operands of the
expression.

[cols="24%,38%,38%",options="header",]
|================================================
| Pattern         | Matched by | Not matched by
| `X:real+Y:real` | `3.5+2.9`  | `3+2`, `3.5-2.9`
| `X and Y`       | `N and 3`  | `N or 3`
|================================================

Definitions for such patterns are called _infix definitions_, and the
corresponding expressions are called _infix expressions_.

==== Argument splitting

When the pattern is an infix, a prefix or a postfix, it also matches a
name if that name is bound to an infix, prefix or postfix expression
that would match. In that case, the bound value is said to be
_((split))_ to match the parameters.
(((argument splitting)))

[width="100%",cols="24%,38%,38%",options="header",]
|==========================================================================
| Pattern     | Matched by                            | Not matched by
| `write X,Y` | `write Items` when `Items is "A","B"` | `write Items`
                                                        when
                                                        `Items is "A"+"B"`,
                                                        `wrote 0,1`
| `write X%`  | `write Items` when `Items is 2%`      | `write Items`
                                                        when
                                                        `Items is 2!`
| `write -X`  | `write Items` when `Items is -2`      | `write Items`
                                                        when
                                                        `Items is +2`
|==========================================================================

[NOTE]
====
A very common idiom is to use comma `,` infix to separate
multiple parameters, as in the following definition:

[source]
----
write Head, Tail is write Head; write Tail
----

This declaration will match `write 1, 2, 3` with bindings `Head is 1`
and `Tail is 2,3`. In the evaluation of the body with these bindings,
`write Tail` will then match the same declaration again with `Tail`
being split, resulting in bindings `Head is 2` and `Tail is 3`.
====

==== Conditional patterns

When a top-level pattern is an infix like `Pattern when Condition`, then
the pattern matches an expression if the pattern on the left of the
infix matches the expression, and if the expression on the right
evaluates to `true` after bindings

[cols="24%,38%,38%",options="header",]
|=================================================
| Pattern            | Matched by | Not matched by
| `log X when X > 0` | `log 3.5`  | `log(-3.5)`
|=================================================

Such patterns are called _conditional patterns_. They do not match if
the expression evaluates to anything but `true`, notably if it evaluates
to any kind of error. For example:

[source]
----
log X when X > 0 is ...
log "Logging an error"        // Will not match the definition above
----

==== Literal constants

When the pattern is an `integer` like `0`, a `real` like `3.5`, a `text`
like `"ABC"`, it only matches an expression with the same value, as
verified by evaluating the `Pattern = Value` expression, where `Pattern`
is the literal constant in the pattern, and `Value` is the evaluated
value of the expression. Checking that the value matches will therefore
require link:#immediate-evaluation[immediate evaluation].

[cols="24%,38%,38%",options="header",]
|==============================================
| Pattern  | Matched by      | Not matched by
| `0!`     | `N!` when `N=0` | `N!` when `N<>0`
|==============================================

This case applies to sub-patterns, as was the case for `0! is 1` in
the link:#factorial[definition of factorial]. It also applies to
top-level patterns, which is primarily useful in link:#scoping[maps]:

[source]
----
digits is
    0 is "Zero"
    1 is "One"
----

==== Metabox values

When the pattern is a an expression between two square brackets, like
`+[[true]]+`, it is called a _metabox_, and it only matches a value that
is equal to the value computed by the metabox. This equality is checked
by evaluating `Pattern = Value`, where `Pattern` is the expression in
the metabox, and `Value` is the expression being tested.

[cols="24%,38%,38%",options="header",]
|====================================================
| Pattern      | Matched by          | Not matched by
| `+[[true]]+` | `true`, `not false` | `"true"`, `1`
|====================================================

A metabox is used in particular when a name would be interpreted as a
parameter. The two declarations below declare a short-circuit boolean
`and` operator:

[source]
----
[[true]]  and X   is X
[[false]] and X   is false
----

By contrast, the two definitions would not work as intended, since they
would simply declare parameters called `true` and `false`, always
causing the first one to be evaluated for any `A and B` expression:

[source]
----
true  and X       is X
false and X       is false
----

==== Blocks

When the pattern is a block, it matches what the block’s child would
match. In other words, blocks in patterns can be used to change the
relative precedence of operators in a complex expression, but play
otherwise no other role in pattern matching.

[cols="24%,38%,38%",options="header",]
|============================================================
| Definition                 | Matched by    | Not matched by
| `+(X+Y)*(X-Y) is X^2-Y^2+` | `[A+3]*[A-3]` | `(A+3)*(A-4)`
|============================================================

The delimiters of a block cannot be tested that way. In other words, a
pattern with angle brackets can match parentheses or conversely. For
example, `[A:integer]` will match `2` or `(2)` or `{2}`.

It is possible to test the delimiters of a block, but that requires a
conditional pattern. For example the following code will check if its
argument is delimited with parentheses:

[source]
----
has_parentheses B:block when B.opening = "(" and B.closing = ")"  is true
has_parentheses B:block                                           is false
----

In some cases, checking if an argument matches a pattern requires
evaluation of the corresponding expression or ((sub-expression)). This is
called link:#immediate-evaluation[immediate evaluation]. Otherwise,
link:#lazy-evaluation[evaluation will be lazy](((lazy evaluation))).

[NOTE]
=====
*STYLE* The rules of pattern matching give a lot of freedom with
respect to coding style. Several conventions are recommended and are
generally followed in this document:

* When a function takes multiple parameters, they are generally
represented using a comma-separated parameter list, altough in some
cases, other infix operators would do just as well:
+
[source]
----
circle CenterX:real, CenterY:real, Radius:real is ...
----
* When there is such a comma-separated parameter list and when there
is more than one formal parameter, it is customary to surround it with
parentheses when the function is intended to be used in expressions,
because in such an expression context, the parentheses are necessary
at the call site. For example, if `circle` is intended to create a
`circle` object rather than to draw a circle, the above definition
might be written as follows:
+
[source]
----
circle (CenterX:real, CenterY:real, Radius:real) as circle is ...
C : circle := circle(0.3, 2.6, 4.0)
----
=====

==== Scope pattern matching

[[parameter-scope]]
[[argument-scope]]
When a block in a pattern defines a link:#scoping[scope], i.e. a
link:#sequences[sequence] of declarations or definitions, that scope
is called a _((parameter scope))_, and it can be matched by any
_((argument scope))_ that provides matching definitions. In that case,
the definitions in the argument scope may be provided in a different
order, and the scope does not need to use the same delimiters or separators:

[source]
----
circle(Radius:real, CenterX:real, CenterY:real) as circle <1>
C1 : circle := circle(3.5, 2.6, 3.2) <2>
C2 : circle := circle(CenterX is 0.0; CenterY is 1.5; Radius is 2.4) <3>
C3 : circle := circle <4>
    Radius  is 1.5
    CenterX is 3.5
    CenterY is 2.4
----
<1> The formal parameters are a comma-separated sequence of
    declarations, meaning that they form a valid scope. A semi-colon
    or new-line could interchangeably be used there.
<2> This is the normal _((positional form))_ for argument passing.
<3> An argument scope is passed, which contains the necessary
    definitions to match the parameter scope. A semi-colon `;` must be
    used to separate the definitions, because the comma `,` has a
    higher precedence than `is`, and therefore cannot be used to
    separate `is` definitions without parentheses.
<4> The argument scope need not use the same separators as the
    parameter scope. Using indentation and line separators removes the
    need for parentheses, since all kinds of blocks are equivalent.

This form is often used for data types containing a large number of
parameters:

[source]
----
type person matches person
    first_name : text
    middle_name: text
    last_name  : text
    birthdate  : date
    address    : address
JohnDoe : person := person
    last_name   is "Doe"
    first_name  is "John"
    middle_name is "W"
    birthdate   is date { Month is December; Day is 5; Year is 1968 }
    address     is address
        city    is "New-York"
        street  is "42nd"
        no      is 42
        zip     is 00002
----

==== Pattern-matching scope

[[pattern-scope]]
When matching a pattern, a link:#execution-context[local execution context]
is created that holds the bindings associated to the patterns being
matched. This _((pattern-matching scope))_ is used while evaluating
the body of the definition.

Consider the following simple example:

....
foo T:text, A:real is
    print "T=", T, " A=", A
foo "Hello", 2.5
....

As link:#evaluation-phase[indicated earlier], the body associated to
the `foo` pattern will evaluate with a pattern-matching scope that
looks like:

....
CONTEXT1 is
    T : text is "Hello"
    A : real is 2.5
....

This is particularly useful for structured data values and
user-defined data types. In XL, link:#types[types] are defined by the
shape of a parse tree, and that shape is typically defined using a
pattern. The link:#scoping[scoping operator] can then be used on
values of the type to access the pattern scope.

For example, a `complex` data type and the addition of `complex`
numbers can be written as follows:

....
complex is type complex(Re:real, Im:real) <1>
Z1:complex + Z2.complex as complex is complex(Z1.Re+Z2.Re, Z1.Im+Z2.Im) <2>
Z:complex := complex(1.3, 4.5) + complex(6.3, 2.5) <3>
....
<1> This is a link:#types[((type definition))] based on a pattern.
    It indicates that the `complex` data type corresponds to all the
    values that have the parse-tree shape following `type`.
<2> The `Z1.Re` notation is a link:#scoping[scoping operator], and
    evaluates `Re` in the pattern-matching scope of `Z1`.
<3> Two link:#creation[constructors] create two `complex` values, that
    are bound to `Z1` and `Z2` respectively. In the expression
    `Z1.Re`, the name `Re` is looked up in pattern-matching scope for
    these constructors, so that `Z1.Re` is `1.3` and `Z2.Im` is `2.5`.


=== Declaration selection

An important part in evaluating expressions is to identify which
particular declarations must be used.

* link:#overloading[Overloading] is the ability to discriminate
  between multiple patterns based on the type or value of the
  arguments.

* link:#dynamic-dispatch[Dynamic dispatch] is the ability to perform
  the selection of the right candidate based on run-time values, as
  opposed to compile-time checks.

* link:immediate-evaluation[Immediate evaluation] is any evaluation
  that is necessary in order to resolve overloading or dynamic
  dispatch.

* Conversely, link:#lazy-evaluation[lazy evaluation] is evaluation
  that is deferred until the callee needs to evaluate the value.

==== Overloading

There may be multiple declarations where the pattern matches a given
((parse tree)). This is called _((overloading))_. For example, as we
have seen above, for the multiplication expression `X*Y` we have at
least `integer` and `real` candidates that look something like:

[source]
----
X:integer * Y:integer as integer        is ...
X:real    * Y:real    as real           is ...
----

The first declaration above would be used for an expression like `2+3`
and the second one for an expression like `5.5*6.4`. It is important for
the evaluation to be able to distinguish them, since they may result in
very different machine-level operations.

In XL, the various declarations in the context are considered in order,
and the first declaration that matches is selected. A candidate
declaration matches if it matches the whole shape of the tree.

NOTE: Historically, the link:#bootstrapping-xl[XL2]
implementation does not select the first that matches, but the _largest
and most specialized_ match. This is a slightly more complicated
implementation, but not by far, and it has some benefits, notably with
respect to making the code more robust to reorganizations. For this
reason, this remains an open option. However, it is likely to be more
complicated with the more dynamic semantics of XL, notably for
link:#dynamic-dispatch[((dynamic dispatch))], where the runtime cost of
finding the proper candidate might be a bit too high to be practical.

For example, `X+1` can match any of the declarations patterns below:

[source]
----
X:integer + Y:integer
X:integer + 1
X:integer + Y:integer when Y > 0
X + Y
Infix:infix
----

The same `X+1` expression will not match any of the following patterns:

[source]
----
foo X
+1
X * Y
----

Knowing which candidate matches may be possible statically, e.g. at
((compile-time)), for example if the selection of the declaration can
be done solely based on the type of the arguments and parameters. This
would be the case if matching an `integer` argument against an
`integer` parameter, since any value of that argument would match. In
other cases, it may require run-time tests against the values in the
declaration. This would be the case if matching an `integer` argument
against `0`, or against `N:integer when N mod 2 = 0`.

For example, a definition of the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number[Fibonacci sequence] in XL
is given below:

[source]
----
fib 0   is 0
fib 1   is 1
fib N   is (fib(N-1) + fib(N-2))
----

NOTE: Parentheses are required around the
link:#expression-vs-statement[expressions statements] in the last
declaration in order to parse this as the addition of `fib(N-1)` and
`fib(N-2)` and not as the `fib` of `(N-1)+fib(N-2)`.

When evaluating a sub-expression like `fib(N-1)`, three candidates for
`fib` are available, and type information is not sufficient to eliminate
any of them. The generated code will therefore have to evaluate `N-1`.
link:#immediate-evaluation[Immediate evaluation](((immediate evaluation)))
is needed in order to compare the value against the candidates. If the
value is `0`, the first definition will be selected. If the value is
`1`, the second definition will be used. Otherwise, the third
definition will be used.

A ((binding)) may contain a value that may itself need to be
split(((argument splitting))) in order to be tested against the formal
parameters. This is used in the implementation of `print`:

[source]
----
print Items             is { write Items; print }
write Head, Rest        is { write Head; write Rest }
write Item:integer      is ...  // Implementation for integer
write Item:real         is ...  // implementation for real
----

In that case, finding the declaration matching `print "Hello", "World"`
involves creating a binding like this:

[source]
----
CONTEXT1 is
    Items is "Hello", "World"
    CONTEXT0
----

When evaluating `write Items`, the various candidates for `write`
include `write Head, Rest`, and this will be the one selected after
splitting `Items`, causing the context to become:

[source]
----
CONTEXT2 is
    Head is "Hello"
    Rest is "World"
    CONTEXT0
    HIDDEN1 is CONTEXT1
----

A context may contain multiple identical definitions, in which case
the later ones are not visible. A slightly more useful case is to have
multiple definitions that are identical except for their type. In that
case, a definition that requires no ((implicit conversion)) will be
selected over one that does require one. An example of use would be to
provide two representations for the `i` complex constant:

....
type complex            is cartesian or polar
type cartesian          is matching cartesian(Re, Im)
type polar              is matching polar(Mod, Arg)
constant i as cartesian is cartesian(0,1)
constant i as polar     is polar(1, pi/2)
....

==== Dynamic dispatch

As shown above, the declaration that is actually selected to evaluate a
given parse tree may depend on the dynamic value of the arguments. In
the Fibonacci example above, `fib(N-1)` may select any of the three
declarations of `fib` depending on the actual value of `N`. This runtime
selection of declarations based on the value of arguments is called
_((dynamic dispatch))_.

In the case of `fib`, the selection of the correct definition is a
function of an `integer` argument. This is not the only kind of test
that can be made. In particular, dynamic dispatch based on the _type_ of
the argument is an important feature to support well-known techniques
such as link:#object-oriented-programming[object-oriented programming].

Let’s consider an archetypal example for object-oriented programming,
the `shape` class, with derived classes such as `rectangle`, `circle`,
`polygon`, and so on. Textbooks typically illustrate dynamic dispatch
using a `Draw` method that features different implementations depending
on the class. Dynamic dispatch selects the appropriate implementation
based on the class of the `shape` object.

In XL, this can be written as follows:

[source]
----
draw R:rectangle    is ... // Implementation for rectangle
draw C:circle       is ... // Implementation for circle
draw P:polygon      is ... // Implementation for polygon
draw S:shape        is ... // Implementation for shape

draw Something      // Calls the right implementation based on type of Something
----

A single dynamic dispatch may require multiple tests on different
arguments. For example, the `and` binary operator can be defined
(somewhat inefficiently) as follows:

[source]
----
[[false]] and [[false]]     is false
[[false]] and [[true]]      is false
[[true]]  and [[false]]     is false
[[true]]  and [[true]]      is true
----

When applied to types, this capability is sometimes called
_multi-methods_ in the object-oriented world. This makes the XL version
of dynamic dispatch somewhat harder to optimize, but has interesting use
cases. Consider for example an operator that checks if two shapes
intersect. In XL, this can be written as follows:

[source]
----
X:rectangle intersects Y:rectangle  as boolean  is ... // two rectangles
X:circle    intersects Y:circle     as boolean  is ... // two circles
X:circle    intersects Y:rectangle  as boolean  is ... // rectangle & circle
X:polygon   intersects Y:polygon    as boolean  is ... // two polygons
X:shape     intersects Y:shape      as boolean  is ... // general case

if shape1 intersects shape2 then    // selects the right combination
    print "The two shapes touch"
----

NOTE: Type-based dynamic dispatch is relatively similar to the notion
of _((virtual function))_ in {cpp}, although the XL
implementation is likely to be quite different. The {cpp}
approach only allows dynamic dispatch along a single axis, based on
the type of the object argument. {cpp} also features a special
syntax, `shape.Draw()`, for calls with dynamic dispatch, which differs
from the C-style syntax for function calls, `Draw(shape)`. The syntax
alone makes the `intersects` example difficult to write in {cpp}.

As another illustration of a complex dynamic dispatch not based on
types, http://tao3d.sourceforge.net[Tao3D] uses
https://github.com/c3d/tao3D/blob/63e2b358691795e612b027b247c99ad31eb3d0ec/modules/themes/white_christmas/white_christmas.xl#L309[theme
functions] that depend on the names of the slide theme, master and
element, as in:

[source]
----
theme_font "Christmas", "main",       "title"   is font "Times"
theme_font "Christmas", SlideMaster,  "code"    is font "Menlo"
theme_font "Christmas", SlideMaster,  SlideItem is font "Palatino"
theme_font SlideTheme,  SlideMaster,  SlideItem is font "Arial"
----

As the example above illustrates, the XL approach to dynamic dispatch
takes advantage of ((pattern matching)) to allow complex combinations of
argument tests.

==== Immediate evaluation

In the `circumference` examples, matching `2 * pi * Radius` against
the possible candidates for `X * Y` expressions required an evaluation
of `2 * pi` in order to check whether it was a `real` or `integer`
value.  This is called _((immediate evaluation))_ of arguments, and is
required in XL for statements(((statement,immediate evaluation))), but
also in the following cases:

[arabic]
. When the formal parameter being checked has a type annotation, like
`Radius` in our example, and when the annotation type does not match the
type associated to the argument parse tree. Immediate evaluation is
required in such cases in order to check if the argument type is of the
expected type after evaluation. Evaluation is _not_ required if the
argument and the declared type for the formal parameter match, as in the
following example:
+
[source]
----
write X:infix   is  write X.left, " ", X.name, " ", X.right
write A+3
----
+
In that case, since `A+3` is already an `infix`, it is possible to bind
it to `X` directly without evaluating it. So we will evaluate the body
with binding `X:infix is A+3`.
. When the part of the pattern being checked is a constant or a
link:#metabox[metabox]. For example, this is the case in the definition
of the factorial below, where the expression `(N-1)` must be evaluated
in order to check if it matches the value `0` in pattern `0!`:
+
[source]
----
0! is 1
N! is N * (N-1)!
----
+
This is also the case for the condition in `if-then-else` statements, to
check if that condition matches either `true` or `false`:
+
[source]
----
if [[true]]  then TrueBody else FalseBody    is TrueBody
if [[false]] then TrueBody else FalseBody    is FalseBody
----
. When the same name is used more than once for a formal parameter, as
in the following optimization:
+
[source]
----
A - A    is 0
----
+
Such a definition would require the evaluation of `X` and `2 * Y` in
expression `X - 2 * Y` in order to check if they are equal.
. When a conditional clause requires the evaluation of the corresponding
  binding, as in the following example:
+
[source]
----
syracuse N when N mod 2 = 0  is N/2
syracuse N when N mod 2 = 1  is N * 3 + 1
syracuse X+5 // Must evaluate "X+5" for the conditional clause
----

Evaluation of ((sub-expression))s is performed in the order required to test
pattern matching, and from left to right, depth first. Patterns are
tested in the order of declarations. Computed values for sub-expressions
are link:#memoization[memoized](((memoization))), meaning that they
are computed at most once in a given statement.

==== Lazy evaluation

In the cases where immediate evaluation is not required, an argument
will be bound to a formal parameter in such a way that an evaluation of
the formal argument in the body of the declaration will evaluate the
original expression in the original context. This is called _((lazy
evaluation))_. The original expression will be evaluated every time the
parameter is evaluated.

To understand these rules, consider the canonical definition of `while`
loops:

[source]
----
while Condition loop Body is
    if Condition then
        Body
        while Condition loop Body
----

Let’s use that definition of `while` in a context where we test the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture[((Syracuse conjecture))]:

[source]
----
while N <> 1 loop
    if N mod 2 = 0 then
        N /= 2
    else
        N := N * 3 + 1
    print N
----

The definition of `while` given above only works because `Condition` and
`Body` are evaluated multiple times. The context when evaluating the
body of the definition is somewhat equivalent to the following:

....
CONTEXT1 is
    Condition is N <> 1
    Body is
        if N mod 2 = 0 then
            N /= 2
        else
            N := N * 3 + 1
        print N
    CONTEXT0
....

In the body of the `while` definition, `Condition` must be evaluated
because it is tested against metabox `+[[true]]+` and `+[[false]]+` in the
definition of `if-then-else`. In that same definition for `while`,
`Body` must be evaluated because it is a
statement(((statement,immediate evaluation))).

The value of `Body` or `Condition` is not changed by them being
evaluated. In our example, the `Body` and `Condition` passed in the
recursive statement at the end of the `while Condition loop Body` are
the same arguments that were passed to the original invokation. For the
same reason, each test of `N <> 1` in our example is with the latest
value of `N`.

Lazy evaluation can also be used to implement "short circuit" boolean
operators(((optimization,boolean operators))). The following code for
the `and` operator will not evaluate `Condition` if its left operand
is `false`, making this implementation of `and` more efficient than
the one given earlier:

[source]
----
[[true]]  and Condition is Condition
[[false]] and Condition is false
----

=== Functional evaluation

The evaluation of XL expressions borrows a number of ideas that are
somewhat common in functional programming languages, but less common
in imperative programming languages such as Ada, Pascal, C or C++.
These ideas include:

* link:#closures[Closures] are a way to encapsulate declarations in a
  way that makes it safe to pass code fragments as arguments to
  functions.

* link:#memoziation[Memoization] is a way to remember which
  expressions have already been evaluated, in order to optimize
  evaluation but, more importantly, make it deterministic even in the
  presence of non-pure functions (i.e. functions that return different
  values for the same input), such as `random` or `current_time`.

* link:#functions-as-values[First order functions] are functions
  treated as values. Since XL allows notations that are not obviously
  "functional", this may occasionally require an tiny wrapper in XL.

==== Closures

The bindings given in the `while` loop definition above for
`Condition` and `Body` are somewhat simplistic. Consider what would
happen if you wrote the following `while` loop:

[source]
----
Condition is N > 1
while Condition loop N -= 1
----

Evaluating this would lead to a "naive" binding that looks like this:

[source]
----
CONTEXT2 is
    Condition is Condition
    Body is N -= 1
    CONTEXT0
----

That would not work well, since evaluating `Condition` would require
evaluating `Condition`, and indefinitely so. Something needs to be done
to address this.

In reality, the bindings must look more like this:

[source]
----
CONTEXT2 is
    Condition is CONTEXT1 { Condition }
    Body is CONTEXT1 { N-= 1 }
    CONTEXT0
----

[[closure]]
The notation `CONTEXT1 { Condition }` means that we evaluate `Condition`
in ((context)) `CONTEXT1`. This one of the link:#scoping[((scoping operator))s],
which is explained in more details below. A prefix with a context on the
left and a block on the right is called a _((closure))_.

In the above example, we gave an arbitrary name to the closure,
`CONTEXT1`, which is the same for both `Condition` and `Body`. This name
is intended to underline that the _same_ context is used to evaluate
both. In particular, if `Body` contains a context-modifying operation
like `N -= 1`, that will modify the same `N` in the same `CONTEXT1` that
will later be used to evaluate `N > 1` while evaluating `Condition`.

A closure may be returned as a result of evaluation, in which case all
or part of a context may need to be captured in the returned value, even
after that context would otherwise normally be discarded.

[[lambda_function]]
For example, consider the following code defining an ((anonymous function)):

[source]
----
adder N is { lambda X is X + N }
add3 is adder 3     // Creates a function that adds 3 to its input
add3 5              // Computes 8
----

When we evaluate `add3`, a ((binding)) `N is 3` is created in a new context
that contains declaration `N is 3`. That context can simply be written
as `{ N is 3 }`. A context with an additional binding for `M is "Hello"`
could be written something like `{ N is 3; M is "Hello" }`.

The value returned by `adder N` is not simply `{ lambda X is X + N }`,
but something like `{ N is 3 } { lambda X is X + N }`, i.e. a closure that
captures the bindings necessary for evaluation of the body `X + N` at a
later time.

This closure can correctly be evaluated even in a context where there is
no longer any binding for `N`, like the global context after the
finishing the evaluation of `add3`. This ensures that `add3 5` correctly
evaluates as `8`, because the value `N is 3` is _captured_ in the
closure(((closure,capture))).

A closure looks like a prefix `CONTEXT EXPR`, where `CONTEXT` and `EXPR`
are blocks, and where `CONTEXT` is a sequence of declarations.
Evaluating such a closure is equivalent to evaluating `EXPR` in the
current context with `CONTEXT` as a ((local context)), i.e. with the
declarations in `CONTEXT` possibly shadowing declarations in the current
context(((declaration,shadowing))).

In particular, if ((argument splitting)) is required to evaluate the
expression, each of the split arguments shares the same context.
Consider the `write` and `print` implementation, with the following
declarations:

[source]
----
write Head, Tail        is { write Head; write Tail }
print Items             is { write Items; print }
----

When evaluating `{ X is 42 } { print "X=", X }`, `Items` will be bound
with a closure that captures the `{ X is 42 }` context:

[source]
----
CONTEXT1 is
    Items is { X is 42 } { "X=", X }
----

In turn, this will lead to the evaluation of `write Items`, where
`Items` is evaluated using the `{ X is 42 }` context. As a result, the
bindings while evaluating `write` will be:

[source]
----
CONTEXT2 is
    Head is CONTEXT1 { "X=" }
    Tail is CONTEXT1 { X }
    CONTEXT1 is { X is 42 }
----

The whole processus ensures that, when `write` evaluates `write Tail`,
it computes `X` in a context where the correct value of `X` is
available, and `write Tail` will correctly write `42`.

==== Memoization

A ((sub-expression)) will only be computed once irrespective of the number
of overload candidates considered or of the number of tests performed on
the value. Once a sub-expression has been computed, the computed value
is always used for testing or binding that specific sub-expression, and
only that sub-expression. This is called _((memoization))_.

For example, consider the following declarations:

[source]
----
X + 0               is Case1(X)
X + Y when Y > 25   is Case2(X, Y)
X + Y * Z           is Case3(X,Y,Z)
----

If you evaluate an expression like `A + foo B`, then `foo B` will be
evaluated in order to test the first candidate, and the result will be
compared against `0`. The test `Y > 25` will then be performed with the
result of that evaluation, because the test concerns a sub-expression,
`foo B`, which has already been evaluated.

On the other hand, if you evaluate `A + B * foo C`, then `B * foo C`
will be evaluated to match against `0`. Like previously, the evaluated
result will also be used to test `Y > 25`. If that test fails, the third
declaration remains a candidate, because having evaluated `B * foo C`
does not preclude the consideration of different sub-expressions such as
`B` and `foo C`. However, if the evaluation of `B * foo C` required the
evaluation of `foo C`, then that evaluated version will be used as a
binding for `Z`.

Another important effect of memoization is that it limits the number
of evaluation of top-level constants. In other words, a single
evaluation will not "chase constants". Consider the following example:

[source]
----
do_not_chase is
    0 is 1
    1 is 2
    2 is 3
do_not_chase 0          // Returns 1, not 3
----

The evaluation of sub-expression `0` happens only once, and therefore,
`1` is not itself evaluated again for the same sub-expression. This is
quite important to get sensible results for link:#scoping[maps].

NOTE: *RATIONALE* These rules are not just optimizations. They are necessary
to preserve the semantics of the language during ((dynamic dispatch)) for
expressions that are not constant. For example, consider a call like
`fib(random(3..10))`, which evaluates the `fib` function with a random
value between `3` and `10`. Every time `random` is evaluated, it returns
a different, pseudo-random value. The rules above guarantee that the
_same_ value will be used when testing against `0`, `1` or as a binding
with `N`. Witout these rules, it would be possible for the body of the
general case to be called with a value that is `0` or `1`.

==== Functions as values

Unlike in several functional languages, when you declare a "function",
you do not automatically declare a named entity or value with the
function’s name.

For example, the first definition in the following code does not create
any declaration for `my_function` in the context, which means that the
last statement in that code will cause an error.

[source]
----
my_function X is X + 1
apply Function, Value is Function(Value)
apply my_function, 1        // Error: Nothing called 'my_function'
----

NOTE: *RATIONALE* One reason for that choice is that
link:#overloading[overloading] means a multiplicity of declarations
often need to be considered for a single expression. Another reason is
that declarations can have arbitrarily complex patterns. It is not
obvious what name should be given to a declaration of a pattern like
`A in B..C`: a "name" like `in..` does not even "work"
syntactically.

It is not clear how such a name would be called as a function either,
since some of the arguments may themselves contain arbitrary parse
trees, as we have seen for the definition of `print`, where the single
`Items` parameter may actually be a comma-separated list of arguments
that will be split when calling `write Items` and matching it to
`write Head, Tail`.

If you need to perform the operation above, it is however quite easy to
create a map that performs the operation. That map may be given a name
or be anonymous. The following code example shows two correct ways to
write such an `apply` call for a factorial definition:

[source]
----
0!                      is 1
N!                      is N * (N-1)!
apply Function, Value   is Function(Value)

// Using an anonymous map to compute 3!
apply { \N is N! }, 3

// Using a named map to compute 5!
factorial   is { \N is N! }
apply factorial, 5
----

Passing definitions like this might be seen as related to what other
languages call _anonymous functions_, or sometimes _lambda function_ in
reference to Church’s lambda calculus. The way this works, however, is
markedly different internally, and is detailed in the section on
link:#scoping[scoping] above.

=== Special evaluation

A few cases require a special form of evaluation:

* link:#self[Self] is a way to stop the evaluation of a form

* The link:#implicit-result-variable[implicit `result` variable] can be
  used to set the value returned by a declaration.

* The link:#returned-value[returned value] for a declaration follows
  rules that take into account the `result` variable, `return`
  statements and `error` values.

==== Self

In a definition body, `self` refers to the input ((parse tree)). A
special idiom is a definition where the body is `self`, called a
_((self definition))_.  Such definitions indicates that the item being
defined needs no further evaluation. For example, `true` and `false`
can be defined as:

[source]
----
true    is self
false   is self
----

This means that evaluating `true` will return `true`, and evaluating
`false` will return `false`, without any further
evaluation(((evaluation,self))). Note that you cannot write for
example `true is true`, as `true` in the body is a statement, which
would require further evaluation, hence an ((infinite recursion)).

It is possible to use `self` for data structures. For example, in order
to ensure that comma-separated lists are not evaluated, you can write :

[source]
----
X, Y    is self
----

Note that the following values also evaluate as themselves:

[arabic]
. `integer`, `real` or `text` constants, unless an explicit declaration
in the current context matches.
. Sequences of declarations, like `{ Zero is 0; One is 1 }`, in
particular the contexts captured(((closure,capture))) for
link:#closures[((closure))s].

==== Implicit result variable

Within the body of a definition, an implicit variable called `result`
holds the value that will be given to the caller. For example, an
iterative version of the factorial function can be written as follows:

....
factorial N:natural as natural is
    result := 1
    for I in 2..N loop
        result *= I
....


==== Returned value

The value returned by the body of a definition is, in order:

. the value of a `return` statement if there is one. A `return`
  statement immediately stops evaluation.
. the value of any statement that link:#error-handling[returns an `error`].
. the last value assigned to the `result` variable
. if `result` was never assigned to in the body, the value of the last
  statement evaluated in the body.

For example, in addition to the definition given in the previous
section, a factorial can be written as follows using a `return`
statement, although it is not quite idiomatic:

....
factorial_return N:natural as natural is
    if N = 0 then
        return 1
    return N * factorial_return(N-1)
....

An alternate form would use the last returned value:
....
factorial_last N:natural as natural is
    if N = 0 then
        1
    else
        N * factorial_last(N-1)
....

==== Assignments and moves

[[assignment]]
The infix `:=` operator is used to perform _((assignments))_ and
returns the value being assigned. Variants such as `+=`, `-=`, `*=`,
`/=` are equivalent to performing the corresponding operating and
assigning the result.

[source]
----
X : integer := 0    // Initialize X to 0
X := 5              // Now X contains value 5
X += 7              // Now X contains value 12
----

NOTE: The `:=` operator (and only that operator) is a _variable
declaration_ when its left operand is an infix `:`. This was discussed
link:#sequences[earlier], and corresponds to the first line in the
example above. A variable declaration is _not_ an assignment.

[[operator_assignment]]
Seven combined operators are defined independently of the type as
follows:

[source]
----
X += Y      is      X := X + Y
X -= Y      is      X := X - Y
X *= Y      is      X := X * Y
X /= Y      is      X := X / Y
X &= Y      is      X := X & Y
X |= Y      is      X := X | Y
X ^= Y      is      X := X ^ Y
----

XL offers two additional operators, the `:+` _copy_ operator and the
`:<` _move_ operator (which is also sometimes _cut_ operator because of
its shape that evokes scissors). The `:+` operator guarantees that all
data is being copied, and that the new object is an independent copy of
the original (hence the `+` character in it). The `:<` operator may
simply move ownership of the value if that is less expensive than
copying it, and invalidates the right side of the operator, which may no
longer be used.

Depending on the data type, `:=` may correspond to a copy or a move. The
precise details of which operator is selected and the associated
rationale are detailed in link:#ownership[the next
chapter]. In all cases, the previous value that was held in the left
operand is link:#destruction[destroyed] by the
assignment.

The `:=` operator is used to transfer arguments to parameters. This
means that passing an argument in XL, like in Rust, can make the
argument invalid in the caller if it is moved rather than copied. There
are, however, multiple ways to pass arguments. This is all discussed in
more details link:#binding[in the next chapter].

NOTE: *RATIONALE* For simple types such as arithmetic types, an assignment
performs a copy, which is a relatively inexpensive memmory copy between
fixed-size locations. For more complicated data types, such as
`spreadsheet`, `graph` or `picture`, a copy involves copying possibly
megabytes of data, or complex webs of interconnected objects, which can
be very expensive, and often leaves an unused copy behind. For such data
types, moving data is the frequently desirable operations, for example
to pass objects around as arguments, and copying data is the less
frequent case. In any case, the programmer remains in charge, always
having the possibility to explicitly request a copy or a move.


=== Scoping

The term _scoping_ refers to the set of rules that describe the
hierarchical relationship between declarations.

* link:#nested-declarations[Nested declarations] are declarations
  within declarations or blocks, and are not visible outside of the
  enclosing declaration or block.

* link:#scopes-and-maps[Scopes] describe the set of declarations that
  are visible at any given point. Users can explicitly define scopes
  using _((maps))_, which are blocks containing only declarations.

* The link:#context[`context`] variable refers to the current context,
  which makes it possible to easily pass a context around.

* The link:#enclosing-context[`super`] variable refers to the
  immediately enclosing context.

* The link:#static-context[`static`] variables refers to a static
  context which keeps its value from one evaluation of the context to
  the next.

* The link:#global-context[`global`] variable refers to a global
  context that is shared by all entities in the program.

* The link:#thread-context[`thread`] variable refers to a per-thread
  context that can be used to optimize operations on multiprocessor systems.

==== Nested declarations

A definition body, or any block for that matter, may itself contain
declarations, which are called _((nested
declarations))_(((declaration,nested))).

When the body is evaluated, a _((local declaration))(((declaration,local)))
phase_ will run, followed by a _local evaluation phase_. The local
link:#declaratiion-phase[declaration phase] will add the local
declarations at the beginning of a new context, which will be
destroyed when the body evaluation terminates. The local declarations
therefore shadow declarations from the enclosing context.

For example, a function that returns the number of vowels in some text
can be written as follows:

[source]
----
count_vowels InputText is
    is_vowel C is
        Item in Head, Tail  is Item in Head or Item in Tail
        Item in RefItem     is Item = RefItem
        C in 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'

    Count : integer := 0
    for C in InputText loop
        if is_vowel C then
            Count += 1
    Count
count_vowels "Hello World" // Returns 3
----

This code example defines a local helper `is_vowel C` that checks if `C`
is a vowel by comparing it against a list of vowels. That local helper
is not visible to the outer scopes, in other words, to the rest of the
program. You cannot use `is_vowel X` elsewhere in the program, since it is
not present in the outer context. It is, however, visible while
evaluating the body of `count_vowels T`.

Similarly, the local helper itself defines an even more local helper
infix `in` in order ot evaluate the following expression:

....
C in 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'
....

While evaluating `count_vowels "Hello World"`, the context will look
something like:

[source]
----
CONTEXT1 is
    is_vowel C is ...
    Count:integer := 0
    InputText is "Hello World"
    CONTEXT0
----

In turn, while evaluating `is_vowel Char`, the context will look
something like:

[source]
----
CONTEXT2 is
    Item in Head, Tail is ...
    Item in RefItem is ...
    C is 'l'
    CONTEXT1
----

The context is sorted so that the innermost definitions are visible
first, possibly shadowing outer
declarations(((declaration,shadowing))). Also, outer declarations are
visible from the body of inner ones.  In the example above, the body
of `is_vowel Char` could validly refer to `Count` or to `InputText`.

[NOTE]
====
This example is designed for illustration purpose only. It is not
idiomatic XL, since the ((standard library)) provides useful tools. A better
way to write it would be:

....
count_vowels InputText is count C in InputText where C in "aeiouyAEIOUY"
....
====

==== Scopes and maps

A list of declarations, similar to the kind that is used in
link:#closures[((closure))s], is called a _((map))_ and evaluates as itself. One
of the primary uses for maps is to create a common _((scope))s_ for
the declarations(((declaration,scope))) that it contains. Since the
link:#declaration-phase[declaration phase] operates on entire blocks,
all declarations within a scope are visible at the same time.

There are two primary operations that apply to a map:

[arabic]
. _Applying_ a map(((map,application))) as a prefix to an operand, as
  we saw with closures, evaluates the operand in the context defined by
  overlaying the map definitions on top of the current context.
. _Scoping_ an expression within a map uses the infix `.` operator,
  where the expression on the right is evaluated in a context that
  consists _exclusively_ of the declarations in the map on the left.

Evaluating a closure is a prime example of map application. The
context is captured by the closure(((closure,capture))) in a map, and
the closure itself is a prefix that corresponds to the map
application. Such an expression can also be created explicitly. For
example, `{ X is 40; Y is 2 } { X + Y }` will evaluate as `42`, taking
`X` and `Y` from the map, and taking the declaration used to evaluate
`X + Y` from the current context.

Another common usage for maps is to store declarations where the
patterns are constant values(((pattern,constant))). For example, you
can use a map called `digit_spelling` to convert a digit to its
English spelling:

[source]
----
digit_spelling is
    0 is "zero"
    1 is "one"
    2 is "two"
    3 is "three"
    4 is "four"
    5 is "five"
    6 is "six"
    7 is "seven"
    8 is "eight"
    9 is "nine"
----

With this declaration, the expression `digit_spelling 3` evaluates to
`"three"`. This kind of map application is called _((indexing))_. A
suggested style choice is to make the intent more explicit using ((square
brackets)), i.e. `digit_spelling[4]`, as a nod to the syntax of
programming languages such as C or {cpp}.

When the ((index)) is an expression, for example `digit_spelling[A+3]` in a
context where `A is 2`, we must evaluate `A+3` in the current context
augmented with the declarations in `digit_spelling`. In other words,
the relevant context for evaluation will look something like:

....
{ X:integer+Y:integer as integer is ... }
  { A is 2 }
    { 0 is "zero"; 1 is "one"; ... }
      [A+3]
....

The first candidate for evaluation has pattern `0`. This requires
link:#immediate-evaluation[immediate evaluation] of expression `A+3` to
check if it matches the value. Naively, one might think that
evaluating it requires matching once more against `0`, and that the
evaluation would neve terminate. However,
link:#memoization[memoization] of sub-expression `A+3` means that it
can no longer be evaluated in the inner context.

It can still, however, be evaluted in the outer context. In that outer
context, the pattern matches the `X:integer+Y:integer` pattern, from
which it computes value `2+3`, and then returns `5` for comparison in
the inner context, in order to compare it against `0`. Since `0=5`
fails, it then considers the next candidate, but again because of
memoization, there is no need to re-evaluate the value of
sub-expression `A+3`. Instead, the computed value `5` will be compared
successively against `1`, `2`, and so on, until it matches `5`. The
returned value for the inner expression is therefore `"five"`.

A map is not restricted to constant patterns. For example, the following
map performs a more complete spelling conversion for numbers below 1000
(the notation `\N` being a shortcut for `lambda N`):

[source]
----
number_spelling is
    \N when N<10    is digit_spelling[N]
    11              is "eleven"
    12              is "twelve"
    13              is "thirteen"
    14              is "fourteen"
    15              is "fifteen"
    16              is "sixteen"
    17              is "seventeen"
    18              is "eighteen"
    19              is "nineteen"
    20              is "twenty"
    30              is "thirty"
    40              is "forty"
    50              is "fifty"
    60              is "sixty"
    70              is "seventy"
    80              is "eighty"
    90              is "ninety"
    \N when N<100   is (number_spelling[N/10*10] & " " &
                        digit_spelling[N mod 10])
    \N when N<1000  is (digit_spelling[N/100] & " hundred and " &
                        digit_spelling[N mod 100])
----

Another common idiom is to use a named map to group related
declarations. This is the basis for the XL module system. For example,
consider the following declaration:

[source]
----
byte_magic_constants is
    num_bits    is 8
    min_value   is 0
    max_value   is 255
----

With that declaration, `byte_magic_constants.num_bits` evaluates to `8`.
A declaration like this can of course be more than a simple name:

[source]
----
magic_constants(Bits) is
    num_bits    is Bits
    min_value   is 0
    max_value   is 2^Bits - 1
----

In that case, `magic_constants(4).max_values` will evaluate to `15`.

This is also exactly what happens when you `use` a module. For example,
with `use IO = XL.CONSOLE.TEXT_IO`, a local name `IO` is created in the
current context that contains the declarations in the module. As a
result, `IO.write` will refer to the declaration in the module.


==== Current context

The `context` variable can be used to access the current scope at any
point of the program. This can be used in particular to pass the
current context to some other declaration:

[source]
----
X : integer := 42

foo Ctx, Value is
    Ctx.X := Value
    Ctx.{ Y is "Hello" }

foo context, 33

print "X=", X, " Y=", Y   // Prints 33 Hello
----

NOTE: The ability to inject something in a context as indicated above
has some interesting use cases. For example, an object-oriented
package could inject a "virtual functions table" field in the types
that are passed to it. Whether this can be implemented in a sane and
safe way remains to be validated.


==== Enclosing context

In a given context, `super` is a way to refer to the enclosing scope.

[source]
----
X is 42
foo X:integer is X + super X    // super X refers to X above
foo 3                           // Returns 45
----

NOTE: In this specific use-case, the notation `super.X` would find the
declaration for `X`. In general, however, it is more advisable to use
`super X` in order to find `X` even if it's defined in some enclosing context.


==== Static context

THe `static` name can be used to refer to a context that is specific
to the current scope, but remains from one evaluation of that scope to
the next.

[source]
----
foo is
   static.{ Counter : natural := 0 }
   static.Counter := static.Counter + 1
   X + static.Counter

for I in 1..5 loop
    print "foo = ", foo    // Prints 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
----

The `static` sugar for declarations creates types that store their
values in the static context. The above code can be written as:

[source]
----
foo is
   static Counter : natural := 0
   Counter := Counter + 1
   X + Counter

for I in 1..5 loop
    print "foo = ", foo    // Prints 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
----


==== Global context

The `global` name can be used to refer to the global context, which is
a special static context shared by all modules and all scopes in the
system.

[source]
----
// Access the C errno variable
global.{ errno as integer is C.errno }

if some_C_function() < 0 then
    print "Function failed with errno=", global.errno
----

NOTE: The `global` context is _not_ visible by default unlike in
languages such as C or C++. One reason for this choice is that global
state is often a source of problems, so XL does not make it overly
easy to create global variables.


==== Thread context

The `thread` name can be used to refer to a per-thread global
context. Like the `static` context, the `thread` context is local to
the current scope.

[source]
----
// Process next-item
thread.{ work_items as list of tasks }
global.{ work_items as list of tasks;
next_work_item as [work_item or nil] is
    if not thread.work_items.empty then
        pop thread.work_items
    else
        single_threaded
           if not global.work_items.empty then
               pop global.work_items
           else
               nil
----

NOTE: It's unclear if there is a real need for a per-thread global
scope. If so, it could be called `thread.global`.


=== Error handling

Code that fails will generally report it by returning an `error` value.
Error values have the link:#errors[`error` type]. For
example, consider the `sqrt` (square root) function. That function is
only defined for positive values.

[source]
----
sqrt X:real as real     when X >= 0     is ...
print "Square root of 2 is ", sqrt 2        // OK
print "Square root of -1 is ", sqrt(-1)     // Error
----

This program will print something similar to the following

[source,console]
----
Square root of 2 is 1.41421356237
Square root of -1 is Error: No form matches sqrt(-1)
----

This message is not very informative. For that reason, it is customary
to add specific error messages for well-identified conditions:

[source]
----
sqrt X:real as real     when X >= 0     is ...
sqrt X:real as error    when X <  0     is error "Square root of negative real ", X
----

In that case, the output will change to something like:

[source,console]
----
Square root of 2 is 1.41421356237
Square root of -1 is Error: Square root of negative real -1.0
----

There are multiple ways to handle errors:

* link:#taking-error-parameters[Taking error parameters] lets you
  explicitly deal with errors, for example to show an error message.
* link:#fallible-types[Fallible types] deal with cases where you expect
  a value or an error.
* link:#try-catch[Try-Catch] will let you special-case error conditions.
* link:#error-statements[Error statements] automatically propagate
  errors without cluttering your code with error checking conditions.

==== Taking error parameters

The simplest way to handle errors is to have a variant of the function
that takes an `error` as an argument. For example, you could extend your
square root function as follows:

[source]
----
sqrt X:real as real     when X >= 0     is ...
sqrt X:real as error    when X <  0     is error "Square root of negative real ", X
sqrt E:error as error                   is error "Square root of error: ", E
----

Now if you attempt to take the square root of an error, you will get a
different output:

[source]
----
print "Double error is ", sqrt(sqrt(-1))
Double error is Error: Square root of error: Square root of negative real -1.0
----

NOTE: As the code above illustrates, `print` and `write` are examples
of functions that take an `error` parameter. In that case, these
functions will print the associated error message.

==== Fallible types

Another way to handle errors is to use `mayfail T` types, which hold
either a `T` or an `error`. The `mayfail` type (without a type
argument) is the same as `mayfail nil`, and is normally used for
functions that are not expected to return a value, but can return an
error.

`mayfail T` contains four accessible features:

* `value` is a `T` value, and can only be accessed when there was no
error (otherwise, it returns… an `error`!)
* `error` is an `error` value that should only be accessed when there
was an error. Otherwise, it returns `nil`.
* `good` is `true` if there was no error, and `bad` otherwise.
* `bad` is equivalent to `not good`.

The following code shows how to use a `mayfail real` type to return
`0.0` for the `sqrt` of a negative value:

[source]
----
sanitized_sqrt X:real as real is
    R : mayfail real := sqrt X
    if R.bad then
        print "Got an error in sqrt: ", R.error
        R := 0.0
    return R.value
----

==== Try-Catch

A third way to handle errors is to use a `try Body catch Handler` form,
which evaluates `Body`, and if `Body` returns an `error`, evaluates
`Handler` instead. The error that was caught by `catch` is called
`caught`.

With this construct, the `sanitized_sqrt` above can be written in a much
shorter and more idiomatic way as follows:

[source]
----
sanitized_sqrt X:real as real is
    try
        sqrt X
    catch
        print "Got an error in sqrt: ", caught
        0.0
----

NOTE: This may look like exception handling, and intentionally so.
However, `error` values are not exceptions in that they don’t
automatically propagate across functions like {cpp} exceptions do. If an
error happens at some level, you must deal with it at that level, if
only to explicitly pass it along. This is done
link:#error-statements[automatically] in many cases, so that the end
result may feel a little like exceptions, but conceptually, this is
always an `error` value being returned, not an exception being thrown.

==== Error statements

If a statement, assignment or declaration returns an `error`, then as a
special evaluation rule, that any `error` value is immediately returned by
the enclosing function. It is a type error if the interface of the
enclosing function does not allow an `error` return value.

For example, in C, it is frequent to have code that looks like:

[source,c]
----
Thing *read_thing_from_file(const char *filename)
{
    FILE *file = fopen(filename, "r");
    if (file == NULL)
        return NULL;
    Thing *thing = malloc(sizeof(Thing))
    if (thing == NULL)
    {
        fclose(file);
        return NULL;
    }
    thing->header = malloc(sizeof(ThingHeader));
    if (thing->header == NULL)
    {
        free(thing);
        fclose(file);
        return NULL;
    }
    size_t header_read = fread(&thing->header, 1, sizeof(ThingHeader), file);
    if (header_read != sizeof(ThingHeader))
    {
        free (thing->header);
        free (thing);
        fclose(file);
        return NULL;
    }
    if (thing->header.size < MIN_SIZE)
    {
        log_error("Header size is too small: %u", thing->header.size);
        free(thing->header);
        free(thing);
        fclose(file);
        return NULL;
    }
    // ... possibly more of the same
    fclose(file);
    return thing;
}
----

In XL, handling `error` values is implicit, so that code similar to the
above can be written as follows:

[source]
----
read_thing_from_file FileName:text as mayfail own thing is
    F:file := file(FileName)            // May error out <1>
    H:own thing_header := read(F)       // May error out (and close F) <2>
    if H.size < MIN_SIZE then
        // Explicitly error out with custom message
        error "Header size %1 is too small", H.size <3>
    T:own thing := thing(H)             // May error out, dispose H, close F <4>
    // ... possibly more of the same
    T
----
<1> This may error out if you cannot open the file, for example
    because it does not exist. This would typically return a
    `file_error`.
<2> This may error out because of an I/O error, but also because of a
    storage error if there isn't enough heap space to allocate the
    `thing_header`.
<3> This is a case where you explicit error out. Since `error` builds
    an `error` value, it also implicitly returns from the function.
<4> This might error out if making a `thing` out of `H` fails, but
    also if a `storage_error` is raised trying to find some heap space
    for a `thing`.

The notation `own T` above is an link:#ownership[owning type] that
dynamically allocates an object from the heap.

=== [[interface]][[implementation]]Interface and implementation

XL provides strong _encapsulation_ by allowing a programmer to hide
irrelevant details of an implementation. This is fundamental to provide
a robust link:#modules[module system].

All values in XL expose an _interface_, which define _what_ can be done
with the value, and also have an _implementation_ of their interface to
tell the program _how_ operations actually happen. The interface needs
to be visible for the program to be correct, but various mechanisms may
allow to hide the implementation.

For example, a variable `integer` value named `X` has the following
interface:

[source]
----
X : integer
----

This is all that is really needed in order to recognize the validity and
meaning of operations such as `X+X`, `2*X+1`, `X<0` or `X:=18`. The
actual value of `X` does not matter. In other words, it is sufficient to
have the interface above to use `X`, an implementation like the one
shown below can be hidden to the users of `X`:

[source]
----
X : integer := 42
----

The same is true for functions. For example, a function checking if a
value is even could expose the following interface:

[source]
----
is_odd N:integer as boolean
----

Based on this interface alone, I know that I can write code that checks
if a value is even or odd:

[source]
----
for I in 1..100 loop
    if is_odd I then
        print I, " is odd"
    else
        print I, " is even"
----

It does not matter if `is_odd` is actually implemented as follows:

[source]
----
is_odd N:integer as boolean is N mod 2 <> 0
----

or maybe as folows using the bitwise `and` operator:

[source]
----
is_odd N:integer as boolean is N and 1 = 1
----

The link:#declaration-phase[declarations] must specify the interface of
the values being used, but they need not specify the implementation. A
definitions of the value must be provided at some point that matches the
declaration and specifies an implementation, but that definition may be
link:#modules[in a different source file].

NOTE: *RATIONALE* In languages such as {cpp}, some members of a
class can be made _private_ or _protected_. This restricts their
usage, but the compiler (and the programmer) still have knowledge of
internal details of the implementation. This facilitates some
low-level copmiler optimizations (most of which are obsolete or
irrelevant today when link-time optimizations are widely available),
but also results in a number of long-term maintenance issues. Exposing
implementation details in the interface worsens the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_base_class[fragile base class]
problem, since some aspects of the implementation are public enough
that they cannot be modified. In XL, the implementation can be truly
hidden, and an implementation must be able to generate code that does
not depend on the implementation when the situation requires it, for
example if the implementation may be in a different shared library
than the code using the interface.

== Types

XL types are a way to organize values by restricting which operations
can be selected during ((evaluation)). For example, knowing that `A` is a
`real` allows expression `A+A` to match ((declaration pattern))
`X:real+Y:real`, but prevents it from matching pattern
`X:integer+Y:integer`.

In XL, types are based on the _shape_ of link:#the-xl-parse-tree[parse trees].
A type identifies the tree patterns that belong to the type. The
expression `matching Pattern` returns a type that matches the given type
declaration pattern.  For example, the type for all additions where
the first value is a `real` is `matching(A:real+B)`.

This approach to typing means in particular that a same value can
belong to _multiple_ types. For example, the expression `2+3*5`
belongs to `matching(A+B*C)`, but also to `matching(A:integer+B:integer)`,
or to `infix`.  Therefore, for XL, you shouldn’t talk about _the_ type
of a value, but rather about _a_ type. However, in the presence of a
type annotation, it is customary to talk about _the type_ to denote
the single type indicated by the annotation. For example, for
`X:integer`, we will ordinarily refer to the type of `X` as being
`integer`, although the value of `X`, for example `2`, may also belong
to other types such as `even_integer` or `positive_integer` or
`matching(2)`, a type that only contains the value `2`.

=== Type annotations

A ((type)) can be associated to a name or expression using a
_((type annotation))_. For example, a type annotation such as
`X:integer` indicates that the values that can be bound to the name
`X` must belong to the `integer` type.

Two infix operators can be used for type annotations, `X:T` and
`X as T`. Both are annotations indicating that `X` belongs to type `T`.
Typical usage for these two kinds of annotations is illustrated below,
indicating that the `<` operator between two `integer` values has the
`boolean` type:

....
X:integer < Y:integer as boolean
....

The first difference between the two kinds of type annotations is
parsing precedence. The infix `:` has precedence higher than most
operators, whereas infix `as` has a very low precedence. In most
declarations, an infix `:` is used to give a type to formal parameters,
whereas an infix `as` is used to give a type to the whole expression.
This is illustrated in the example above, where `X:integer` and
`Y:integer` define the types of the two formal parameters `X` and `Y` in
the pattern `X < Y`, and the `as boolean` part indicates that the result
of an operation like `3 < 5` has the `boolean` type.

Another difference is link:#mutability[((mutability))]. If type `T` is not
explicitly marked as `constant` or `variable`, `X:T` indicates that `X`
is mutable, whereas `X as T` indicates that `X` is not mutable. For
example, `seconds : integer` declares a _((variable))_ named seconds,
where you can store your own seconds values, whereas `seconds as
integer` declares a _((function))_ named seconds, possibly returning
the number of seconds in the current time from some real-time clock.

=== Type conversions

In some cases, a value from one type needs to be converted to some
other type. This is called a _((type conversion))_. There are two
kinds of type conversion: _((explicit conversion))_, and _((implicit
conversion))_. In addition, it is also possible to resolve
type-related ambiguities using _((type hints))_.

Explicit type conversions are usually provided using a
link:#creation[constructor]. As a result, they look like any other
expression. For example, if you provide a `distance` type based on
`real`, you might have a creator for `distance` values, and then use
that for explicit conversions.

....
distance is matching distance(D:real)
X:distance + Y:distance as distance     is distance(X.D+Y.D)
....

All prefix functions that use the name of a type are renamed for
derived types. For example:

....
long_distance is distance when distance.D >= 1000.0
km : long_distance := distance 1000.0
Mm : long_distance := long_distance 1_000_000.0
....

....
long_distance as some distance is matching distance(D:real) when D > 1000.0
Z := long_distance(3.3)
....

Implicit type conversions are provided by definitions that have a
single typed parameter and return a different type. For example, if
you want to be able to implicitly convert between polar and cartesian
form for a complex number, you would need:

....
Z:polar as cartesian
Z:cartesian as polar
....

A single implicit type conversion can apply to a single binding, and
is only applied if there is no direct match with the original type.
For example:

....
foo X:complex as complex
X:real as complex
foo 1.0                 // OK, implicit conversion from real to complex
foo 1                   // Error: two implicit conversions required
....

In a case like the one that causes an error, you can use a _type hint_,
which is simply a sequence of explicit conversions indicating how to
get from one type to another.

....
foo X:complex as complex
X:real as complex
foo 1.0                 // OK, implicit conversion from real to complex
foo real 1              // OK: first convert to real, then implicit complex
....

=== Type definitions

In XL, types are values like any other value, which simply match the
`type` type. In particular, types can be declared or
link:#definition[defined] like any other value.

The simplest case of _((type definition))_ simply gives a new name to
an existing type. The following code will create a type named `int`
that is just another name for `integer`:

....
int is integer
....

[[implicit-inheritance]]
[CAUTION]
====
In reality, the above is really equivalent to deriving `int` from
`integer`. in other words, the definition above is equivalent to the
following pattern-based definition:
....
int is matching(base:integer)
....
One reason this is important is to maintain some guarantees during
link:#field-destruction[destruction], specifically make sure that
destruction of the new type does not bypass the destruction of the
original type.
====


More interesting types can be defined using the `matching` function, which
takes a pattern as an argument, and returns a type that
link:#pattern-matching[matches that pattern]. The expression `matching(42)`
returns a type that only matches the value `42`.

The `matching` function can obviously be used to create much more
interesting types. In order to create a `positive` type that only
matches positive values, one only needs the following code:

....
positive is matching(X when X > 0)
....

NOTE: If you come from another language, it is important to realize
that `positive` as defined above is a type that accepts both `integer`
values such as `27` and `real` values such as `3.14`, since the
expression `X > 0` is valid in both cases. As a matter of fact, it
applies to any type where the expression `X > 0` is valid. Types like
this are often used in type expressoins such as `integer and positive`.
Using such types makes it possible to write _((constrained generic code))_,
i.e. code that applies on a large class of cases, while being properly
constrained.

A common usage is to use a named prefix to create types that are
easier to identify. This kind of notation is called a
link:#creation[constructor], and plays for XL the role that `struct`
plays for C or `record` for Pascal. A `complex` data type can be
created and used as shown in the following code:

....
complex is matching complex(Re:real, Im:real)
Z:complex := complex(4.3, 2.1)
....

This definition of `complex` states that a value matches the type
`complex` if and only if it matches the pattern `complex(Re:real, Im:real)`.
In particular, it matches the value `complex(4.3, 2.1)`, which makes
the assignment on the second line of code possible.

Since they are quite frequent, there is a
link:#syntactic-sugar[syntactic sugar] for this kind of declarations:

....
type complex matches complex(Re:real, Im:real)
....

=== Type expressions

Type definitions are not restricted to names. XL offers extensive
support for _((type expressions))_, i.e. expressions that return a type.
For example, the `complex` type might take the `real` type as an
argument, instead of assuming the standard `real` type:

....
type complex[real:type] is matching complex(Re:real, Im:real)
type complex is complex[real]
Z:complex := complex(4.3, 2.1)
K:complex[real32] := complex(1.2, 3.4)
....

Type expressions can be used to create what is called a _((generic
type))_ in languages like Ada, or a _((template))_ in languages like
{cpp}. However, as far as syntax is concerned, it is
indistinguishable from a function taking a type argument and returning
a type. This extends the range of capabilities for the feature,
meaning that the implementation may sometime have fo fall-back to more
dynamically typed ways to evaluate the code.

*STYLE* A stylistic convention is to use square brackets in type
expressions and parentheses in regular expressions. Thus, this
documentation will typically write `complex[real]` for the type
expression, and `complex(1.2,3.4)` for the numerical expression,
although it would be perfectly legal to write `complex real` and
`complex[1.2,3.4]` respectively, since XL does not differentiate
blocks except for precedence.

In practice, type expression are extremely frequent, notably being
used to define a plethora of ((generic type))s using operator-like
notations, like `pointer to T`.
In addition, a large number of link:#standard-types[standard types],
including link:#genneric-containers[generic container types],
can be used to quickly build useful data types.

Standard type expressions include:

* `T1 or T2` is a type that contains values belonging to `T1` or `T2`.
  It is similar to what other languages call union types, and is used
  in particular for error reporting through types like `real or error`.
* `T1 and T2` is a type that contains values belonging both to `T1`
  and `T2`. It is primarily  used to constrain types in generic code,
  for example `integer and positive`.
* `not T` is a type that contains vlaues that do not belong to `T`. It
  can be used to exclude specific types from a definition.
* `mayfail T` is a shortcut for `T or error` and is used when a
  function may fail.
* `one_of Patterns` is a type that accept one of the following
  patterns. It can be used to implement enumerations, such as
  `one_of(RED,GREEN,BLUE)`, but also more complex variant types with
  more complex patterns, like for the definition of `color` below
  which describes various ways to describe a color:
+
....
component is real range 0.0..1.0 bits 16
angle     is real range 0.0..360.0 bits 16
color is one_of
    rgb   Red:component, Green:component, Blue:component
    rgba  Red:component, Green:component, Blue:component, Alpha:component
    hsv   Hue:angle, Saturation:component, Value:component
    hsva  Hue:angle, Saturation:component, Value:component, Alpha:component
    cymk  Cyan:component, Yellow:component, Magenta:component, Black:component
    named Name:text
    named Name:text, Alpha:component
....
* `any_of Patterns` is a type that accept any combination of the
  following patterns. It can be used to implement flags, like the
  representation of Unix-style permissions as `any_of(READ,WRITE,EXECUTE)`,
  but also more complex variant types that may combine multiple
  patterns, as in the `text_style` type defined below, where a text
  style can contain at most a family, a weight, a slant, a fill color
  and a line color:
+
....
text_style is any_of
    family F:font_family
    weigth W:font_weight
    slant S:font_slant
    fill_color C:color
    line_color C:color
....

Below is code for a `complex` type that uses some of these features,
and is somewhat closer to the actual implementation in
`XL.MATH.COMPLEX` than what we have shown so far:

....
complex[real:type]      is real or polar[real] or cartesian[real]
cartesian[real:type]    is matching cartesian(Re:real, Im:real)
polar[real:type]        is matching polar(Mod:real, Arg:real)

with
    real : some number
    C1   : cartesian[real]
    C2   : cartesian[real]
    P1   : polar[real]
    P2   : polar[real]

C1 + C2         is cartesian(C1.Re + C2.Re, C1.Im + C2.Im)
C1 - C2         is cartesian(C1.Re - C2.Re, C1.Im - C2.Im)
P1 * P2         is polar(P1.Mod * P2.Mod, P1.Arg + P2.Arg)
....

=== Variable sized types
Type expressions evaluate following the regular rules of evaluation
for XL. This makes it possible to build types that would be impossible
to build in many mainstream languages, like _((variable sized types))_.
For example, it is frequent, notably in networking, to have a
`packet` that has a _((header))_ followed by a _((payload))_, the
payload having a size that depends on information in the header. In
XL, you can describe a type like this as follows:

....
type header is matching header (byte_count:size)
type payload[byte_count:size] is array[byte_count] of byte
type packet is matching packet
    header  : header
    payload : payload[header.byte_count]
....

The XL type system provides very strong guarantees even for data types
as complicated as this one.  For example, the following code will fail
type system checks:

....
resize (P:inout packet, S:size) is
    P.header.byte_count := S <1>
....
<1> This is a type error on the `packet` type, because the existing
    `payload` field no longer has the correct size, therefore the
    result does not belong to the `packet` type, unless `S` is the
    existing size.

The correct way to write the code above will hightlight the need to
possibly reallocate memory for the new packet, and deal with three
distinct cases for resizing:

....
resize (P:inout packet, S:size) when S = P.header.byte_count is nil
resize (P:inout packet, S:size) when S < P.header.byte_count is
    new_header  : header := header(S)
    new_payload : payload(S) := P.payload[0..S-1]
    P := packet(new_header, new_payload)
resize (P:inout packet, S:size) when S > P.header.byte_count is
    new_header  : header := header(S)
    new_payload : payload(S) := array
        lambda I when I < P.byte_count   is P.payload[I]
        lambda I                         is byte(0)
    P := packet(new_header, new_payload)
....

=== Shared type annotations

In some cases, notably for link:#modules[modules], a number of very
similar declarations will have to be written again and again. For
example, consider that you are writing code for implementing complex
arithmetic. This might look something like:

....
type complex is matching complex(Re:real, Im:real)
Z1:complex + Z2:complex as complex is ...
Z1:complex - Z2:complex as complex is ...
Z1:complex * Z2:complex as complex is ...
Z1:complex / Z2:complex as complex is ...
....

In this code, `Z1` and `Z2` are always `complex` values. It seems
unnecessary to have to repeat the time over and over again. XL offers
a feature, called _((shared type annotations))_, where a `with`
prefix, followed by a block of declarations, can be used to give local
type annotations that will be valid in the entire scope where they are
being used. The above examples could then be written as:

....
type complex is matching complex(Re:real, Im:real)
with
    Z1 : complex
    Z2 : complex
Z1 + Z2 as complex is ...
Z1 - Z2 as complex is ...
Z1 * Z2 as complex is ...
Z1 / Z2 as complex is ...
....

A shared type annotation may contain more complicated type
information. In particular, you can declare the type for expressions.
For example, if you define a factorial expression, you might ensure
that all variants of the definition have a consistent type as follows:

....
with
    N  :  natural
    N! as natural
0! is 1
N! is N * (N-1)!
....

The first declaration within the `with` block indicates that any
variable named `N` will have type `natural`. This is in particular
true for the declaration on the next line. In other words, the second
line in the `with` block is equivalent to:

....
N:natural! as natural
....

The pattern `0!` matches `N:natural!`, and the same is true for the
next declaration. Therefore, the two definitions for the factorial are
equivalent to the code below:

....
0:natural! as natural is 1
N:natural! as natural is N * (N-1)!
....

A shared type annotation can take another form, `with Types in Body`,
which makes it possible to restrict the type annotations to a specific
subset of declarations. The declatations in `Body` really belong to
the scope containing the `with Types in Body` form.

....
with
    Z1 : complex
    Z2 : complex
in
    Z1 + Z2 as complex is ...
    Z1 - Z2 as complex is ...
    Z1 * Z2 as complex is ...
    Z1 / Z2 as complex is ...
....

This is particularly useful to provide complex type parameters in
generic declarations. The following example illustrates this syntax to
declare a notation `find Item in List` where the `Item` must have the
type of the elements of the `List`.

....
with
    T:type
    L:type list of T
in
    find Item:T in List:L as mayfail T
....

=== Standard types

The XL library provides a number of standard types representing
fundamental data types common in most programming languages, as well
as more advanced and more idiomatic data types, such as the types used
as building blocks for a parse tree. This section will only give an
quick overview of many of the available types, with the intent to list
them more than to describe them. A more complete description of the
available types will be given in a later section about the
link:#standard-library[standard XL library].

==== Basic types

Some fundamental data types are available on all implementations, and
do not require any `use` statement. These fundamental types are called
_((basic types))_, and include the following:

* `type` is the type used for types...

* `nil` is a type that contains only the value `nil`. It is generally
  used to represent an absence of value.

* `integer` is an approximation of integer numbers with a limited
  range, typically between -2^63^ and 2^63^-1, which are accessible as
  `integer.min` and `integer.max` respectively. That range cannot be
  less than -2^31^ and 2^31^-1. Overflowing while performing
  operations on `integer` operations behaves like the underlying
  hardware of the ((target machine)), typically ((wrapping values))
  around on all modern hardware. `integer` is a type that matches
  literal values below `integer.min`, such as `12`, or the result of
  the prefix negation operator on literal values, such as `-3`.

* `natural` is an approximation of natural numbers, with a limited
  range, typically between 0 and 2^64^-1. Like `integer`, it behaves
  like the underlying hardware in case of overflow. `unsigned` matches
  whole number literal values such as `0`, `16#FF` or `42`.

* `size` is a type similar to `natural`, but specifically intended to
  represent a size. In some cases, it may have a different range than
  `natural`.

* `count` is a type similar to `natural`, but specifically intended to
  represent a count. It should be at least as large as `size` and
  `natural`.

* `offset` is a type that plays for `integer` the role that `size`
  plays for `natural`, i.e. it is intended to indicate offsets for
  example while indexing an array.

* `byte` is the smallest unsigned type that is naturally represented
  on the machine. On most modern machine, it is an 8-bit value.

* `character` is a representation of the ((native character set)) on the
  target machine. On modern machines, it should generally follow the
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode[Unicode] standard for encoding
  characters. The `character` type matches single-quote
  single-character literal text constants like `'A'`.

* `text` is a representation for sequences of characters. On modern
  machines, it should generally use a compact representation such as
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8[UTF-8], and have an
  link:#interface[interface] that is compatible with the
  link:#string[`string of character`] type. The `text` type matches
  literal text constants that contain any number of characters, for
  example `"Hello World"`.

* `boolean` is a type containing two values, `true` or `false`, and
  intended to represent truth values, for example conditions in tests.
  Unlike languages like C, the `boolean` type is not a numerical type.


==== Sized data types

Basic data types are not very precisely sized, in order to leave the
implementation free to pick up a size that is maximally efficient on
the target machine. For example, `integer` should hold 32-bit values on
a 32-bit machine, and 64-bit values on a 64-bit machine.

This may adversely affect portability, and for that reason, XL also
offers _((sized types))_, with a precise number of bits specified in the
name. The size is appended to the type name. For example, `i64`
is an `integer` type that is guaranteed to be exactly 64-bit.

Such sized data types exist for the following base types:

* `i` for at least 8, 16, 32 and 64 bits, are signed integer values,
* `u` for at least 8, 16, 32 and 64 bits, are unsigned integer values,
* `real` for at least 32 and 64 bits,
* `character` for at least 8, 16 and 32 bits.

Additional sizes may be provided if they are native to the target
machine. For example, some DSPs feature 24-bit operations, and
compilers for such machines should provide types like `u24` to
match.

The sized types are guaranteed to wrap around at the boundary for the
given number of bits. For example, `u8` holds values between
`0` and `255`, and will wrap around so that the next value after `255`
is `0`, and the value preceding `0` is `255`.

When the standard sizes are not sufficient, it is easy to use
integer link:#subtypes[subtypes] to identify precise
link:#range-subtypes[ranges] of values, as in `integer range 1..5`,
which only accepts values between `1` and `5`, or precise
link:#size-subtypes[number of bits], such as `integer bits 24`, which
wraps around like a 24-bit `integer` value.

==== Category types

Some types are intended primarily as an easy way to categorize
values along generally useful boundaries, and are naturally called
_((category types))_. Examples include:

* `anything` is the _((most general type))_, which accepts any
  value. It is typically used to create
  link:#true-generic-types[true generic types].
* `number`, a type that matches numerical data types such as
  `integer`, `real` or `complex`.
* `positive`, a type that accepts only positive values.
* `ordered`, a type that only matches values that can be compared
   using `<`. A variant, `totally_ordered`, ensures that the type is
  totally ordered. This is unfortunately not the case of common types
  such as `real`.
* `discrete`, a type that only matches discrete types, such as
  `integer` or `character`. Discrete types feature an `index` function
  that returns the index of the value in the type.
* `access`, a type that accepts only values used to access other types,
  such as pointers or references.

Category types are often used to implement _((generic algorithm))s_
and _((generic type))s_ without overly burdening the code. For
example, the `vector` type represents a mathematical vector, and that
requires a `number` type for the values in the vector. Similarly, the
`sort` algorithm only works on `ordered` values.

==== Generic containers

In some cases, a general structure is shared by a number of data types.
For example, all array types share an internal organization and provide
similar features. XL features _((generic type))s_ to address this kind
of need. Most often, generic types are declared with formal parameters,
and are _instantiated_(((instantiation))) by supplying arguments for
the required parameters.

This is particularly useful for _((container types))_, i.e. types that
are primarily designed to store a possibly large number of values from
some other type.

Container types include in particular the following:

* `array` store a fixed number of consecutive elements. They exist
  in multiple flavors:
  ** Zero-based arrays such as `array[5] of integer`.
  ** Range-indexed arrays, such as `array['A'..'Z'] of boolean`, which
     are indexed with a `discrete` range of values.
  ** Multi-dimensional arrays such as `array['A'..'H', 1..8] of chess_piece`
     are simply a convenient shortcut for arrays of arrays.

* `string` store a variable number of consecutive elements. They also
  exist in multiple flavors:
  ** Unbounded, zero-based strings, such as `string of integer`.
     The `text` type exposes a `string of character` interface.
  ** Bounded, zero-based strings, such as `string[1000] of integer`,
     which can hold up to `1000` values of the `integer` type.
  ** Bounded, range-indexed strings, such as `string[1..10] of real`,
     which can hold up to `10` values, indexed starting at `1`.
  ** Multi-dimesional strings, such as `string[25,80] of character`,
     which is a storage-efficient way to store possibly blank text screens.

* `list` to store a variable number of linked elements. Unlike arrays
  or strings, elements in lists are individually allocated in memory
  rather than as a large contiguous chunk. Lists exist in several
  flavors:
  ** Single-linked lists such as `list of integer`.
  ** Doubly-linked, double-ended queues, such as `queue of integer`.
  ** Xor-linked lists such as `xor_list of integer`.

* `stack` to expose `push` and `pop` operations, and the type is matched
  by several container type such as `string`, `list` or `queue`. In
  other words, you can treat a `list of T` as a `stack of T`.

* `map` to efficiently map source values to a stored value. For
  example, `map[text] of real` creates a map between `text` index
  values and `real` stored values:

* `set` to efficiently store a set of value, and make it easy to know
  if a value is in the set or not. A `set of character` holds an
  arbitrary number of `character` values.

==== True generic types

Often, an algorithm will apply to all variants of a generic type. For
example, consider the operation that sums all the elements in an
array. Its body can be written so as to not really depend on the type
or number of elements.

In order to make it easier to write such generic code, XL programmers
can take advantage of a feature called _((true generic type))_, which
is a way to define a type that will accept any variant of some
underlying generic type. It is customary to use a name that easily
relates to the generic type. For example, one can define a true
generic type named `array` that covers all array types as follows:

....
type array is matching (array[index:array_index] of value:type)
....

This makes it possible to write true generic code that takes an
`array` argument, as follows:

....
sum(A:array) as A.value is
    result := 0
    for I in A loop
        result += I
....

It is possible for the pattern of the true generic type to be somewhat
more restrictive. For example, for a `complex` type, one might want to
create a type that only accepts numbers for the `real` type. The type
`some T` describes all types that derive from `T`, so that the true
generic type for `complex` can be defined with something like:

....
complex is matching complex[real:some number]
....

A true generic type with constraints like in the above example is
called a _((constrained generic type))_.

[NOTE]
=====
*RATIONALE* In languages such as {cpp}, the lack of this feature
often leads to code that largely repeats the same `template` arguments
for each individual declaration:

[source,c++]
----
template <typename T>
T sum(const vector<T> &v)
{
    T s = 0;
    for (auto i : v)
        s += i;
    return s;
}
----

The recent standards for {cpp} have introduced the notion of
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concepts_(C%2B%2B)[concepts] to
address the need to constrain generic types.
=====


==== Other generic types

Many generic types are not intended as containers.
They include the following:

* `range of T` holds ranges of values of type `T`. For example, the
  type `range of integer` can hold a value such as `1..5`, which is
  the range between values `1` and `5` inclusive.

* `own T` holds a dynamically allocated value of type `T` that is
  link:#ownership[owned] by the `own` value, i.e. it is disposed of
  when the `own` value is link:#destruction[destroyed].

* `ref T` holds a reference to a value of type `T`. Its
  link:#lifetime[lifetime] must be less than the value being
  referenced.

* `in T` can be used to pass input arguments of type `T`, i.e. values
  that are link:#creation[created] and owned by the caller.

* `out T` can be used for output arguments of type `T`, i.e. values
  that are created by the callee.

* `in_out T` can be used for input-output arguments of type `T`,
  i.e. values that can be modified by the callee but are created and
  owned by the caller. Due to the rules about name lookup in XL, it is
  also possible to spell this type as `inout T` or `io T`.

* `any T` can hold a value of type `T` or any
  link:#inheritance[derived type], preserving the original type
  information, so that dynamic dispatch will happen based on the
  actual type.

* `slice of T` holds a slice of contiguous containers such as `array`
  or `string`, and makes it possible to manipulate subsets of the
  container. This is also useful with `text`.

* `access T` matches any type that can be used to access values of
  type `T`, such as `own T`, `ref T` or `slice of T`.

* `attribute T` is an link:#attribute[attribute] with type `T`, i.e. a
  value that can be read or written to in a controlled fashion.

==== Mathematical types

Computers are often used to perform mathematical operations. XL
features several mathematical types designed for that purpose:

* `number` represent all kinds of numbers and is intended to be used
  in generic code.

* `natural` represent natural numbers, i.e. non-negative whole numbers.

* `integer` represent integer numbers, i.e. signed whole numbers.

* `rational` represent rational numbers, i.e. a rato of two whole
  numbers. They can be used to perform accurate computations on ratios.

* `real` is the base floating-point type, but it also provides
  fixed-point link:#real-subtypes[subtypes].

* `range of T` is a type that represents a range of numbers, and
  features range arithmetic, which makes it possible to estimate
  the effect of rounding errors in complex calculations involving
  floating-point types.

* `complex[T]` is a generic representation for complex numbers using
  `T` as the representation for real numbers. Without an argument,
  `complex` denotes `complex[real]`. Values with the `complex` type
  have a `polar` and `cartesian` representation, and the compiler will
  select the representation based on usage.

* `quaternion[T]` is a generic representation for mathematical
  link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion[quaternions], and are
  particularly useful in the field of 3D graphics. Without an
  argument, `quaternion` is the same as `quaternion[real]`.

* `vector` is a generic representation of mathematical
  link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)[vectors],
  which takes a size and a number type, so that `vector[3] of real32`
  represents a 3-dimensional vector of `real32` values, and
  `vector[4]` is a 4-dimensional `real` vector. The `vector`
  type exposes an `array` interface, but also provides additional
  capabilities such as vector arithmetic. Operations on the `vector`
  type typically take advantage of
  link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD[SIMD] or "multimedia"
  operations on the processor if available.

* `matrix` is a generic representation of mathematical
  link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)[matrices],
  with two underlying representations, `sparse` and `dense`. The
  `matrix` type exposes an interface for a two-dimensional `array`
  type. It features matrix algebra and matrix-specific operations,
  as well as operations combining `matrix` and `vector` for the same
  underlying numerical type. Operations on the `matrix` type are often
  highly parallelizable.  The `matrix[4,3] of i32` will create a 4x3
  matrix with `i32` as the underlying numerical type, whereas
  `matrix[2,2]` will create a 2x2 matrix of `real` values.

==== Parse tree types

The `XL.PARSER` module offers a number of types intended to represent
or match elements in the parse tree:

* `tree` matches any parse tree.
* `integer` matches link:#numbers[whole number] literals such as `42`.
* `real` matches link:#numbers[fractional number] literals such as `3.14`.
* `text` matches link:#text[text] literals such as `"ABC"`.
* `character` matches link:#text[character] literals such as `'A'`.
* `name` matches names such as `A`.
* `operator` matches operators such as `+`.
* `symbol` matches either name or operators, as well as an empty
   symbol used in empty blocks, e.g. `()`.
* `infix` matches infix expressions such as `A+B`.
* `prefix` matches prefix expressions such as `+3`.
* `postfix` matches postfix expressions such as `4%`.
* `block` matches block expressions such as `(A)`.

==== Program-related types

A few other types are related to program evaluation, notably:

* `lifetime` represents the link:#lifetime[lifetime] of values.
* `parser` represents an XL parser.
* `evaluator` represents an XL program evaluator.
* `task` represent a running task.

==== Other common types

A number of modules provide various generally useful, if more
specialized types. Here are some examples:

* In module `XL.MEMORY`
** `byte` is a type representing the smallest addressable unit of
   memory, typically 8-bit on most modern implementations.
** `address` is a type representing addresses for the target machine,
   i.e. values that can be used to index individual `byte` elements in
   memory.

* In module `XL.FILE`
** `file` is a representation for a file on the file system, allowing
   *operations such as reading or writing.
** `name` is a representation for file names that can be converted to
   and from `text`.
** `path` is a representation for hierarchical access paths made of
   individual `name` instances
** `directory` is a representation for directories, allowing to get a
    of files.
** `attributes` describe file-related attributes, such as creation and
   modification date or access rights.

There are many more, documented in the section about the
link:#standard-library[standard library].


=== Type-related concepts

A number of essential concepts are related to the type system, and will
be explained more in details below:

* the link:#lifetime[lifetime] of a value is the amount of time during
  which the value exists in the program. Lifetime is, among other things,
  determined by link:#scoping[scoping].
* link:#creation[creation] and link:#destruction[destruction] defines
  how values of a given type are initialized and destroyed.
* link:#errors[errors] are special types used to indicate failure.
* link:#mutability[mutability] is the ability for an entity to change
  value over its lifetime.
* link:#compactness[compactness] is the property of some types to have
  their values represented in the machine in a compact way, i.e. a
  fixed-size sequence of consecutive memory storage units (most generally
  bytes).
* link:#ownership[ownership] is a properties of some types to control
  the lifetime of the associated values or possibly some other resource
  such as a network connection. Non-owning types can be used to
  link:#access-types[access] values of an associated owning type.
* link:#inheritance[inheritance] is the ability for a type to inherit
  all operations from another type, so that its values can safely be
  implicitly converted to values of that other type. Conversely,
  link:#subtypes[subtypes] are types that add constraints to a type.
* the link:#type-interface[interface] of a type is an optional scope that
  exposes _features_ of the type, i.e. individually accessible values. The
  _implementation_ of the type must provide all interfaces exposed in the
  type’s interface.
* link:#transfers[transfers] are the ways values can be exchanged
  between different parts of the program, and include
  link:#copy[copy], link:#move[move] and link:#binding[binding].

==== Lifetime

The lifetime of a value is the amount of time during which the value
exists in the program, in other words the time between its
link:#creation[creation] and its link:#destruction[destruction].

An entity is said to be _live_(((live value))) if it was created but
not yet destroyed.  It is said to be _dead_(((dead value))) otherwise.

NOTE: Some entities may be live but not accessible from within the
current context because they are not visible. This is the case for
variables declared in the caller’s context.

The lifetime information known by the compiler about entity `X` is
represented as compile-time constant `lifetime X`. The lifetime values
are equipped with a partial order `<`, such that the expression
`lifetime X < lifetime Y` being `true` is a compiler guarantee that `Y`
will always be live while `X` is live. It is possible for neither
`lifetime X < lifetime Y` nor `lifetime X > lifetime Y` to be true. This
`lifetime` feature is used to implement
https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.8.0/book/ownership.html[Rust-like]
link:#lifetime[restrictions on access types],
i.e. a way to achieve memory safety at zero runtime cost.

The lifetime of XL values fall in one of the following categories:

* _((global value))s_ become live during the
  link:#declaration-phase[declaration phase] of the program, just
  before its link:#evaluation-phase[evaluation phase], and they remain
  live until the end of that evaluation phase. Global values are
  typically preallocated statically in a reserved area of memory,
  before any program evaluation, by a program called a linker.

* _((local value))s_ become live during the
  link:#nested-declarations[local declaration phase] of the bodies of
  the declarations corresponding to patterns
  link:#pattern-matching[being matched] during the evaluation phase.
  Local values are typically allocated dynamically on a
  link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack[call stack]
  allocated for each thread of execuion. That stack has a limited
  "depth", which may limit the depth of recursion allowed for a
  program.

* [[dynamic_value]]_((dynamic value))s_ are dynamically allocated
  using a "heap", and remain live as long as some other value
  link:#ownership[owns them].  That owning value may itself be a
  global, local or dynamic value.  The heap is typically the largest
  available memory space for the program. XL offers a number of
  facilities to help you manage how this dynamic allocation happens,
  including facilities to build link:#garbage-collection[garbage
  collectors] if and when this is an efficient management strategy.

* _((temporary value))s_ are  created during evaluation of
  expressions, and can be discarded as soon as they have been
  consumed. For example, assuming a definition for `x+y`, the
  expression `a+b+c+d` will be processed as `((a+b)+c)+d`, and the
  result of evaluating `a+b` can be destroyed as soon as `(a+b)+c` has
  been evaluated. Temporary values are typically also allocated on
  the stack.

For example, consider the following piece of code:

....
use XL.CONSOLE.TEXT_IO <1>
use XL.TEXT.FORMAT

print "Starting printing Fibonacci sequences" <2>

fib 0 is 1 <3>
fib 1 is 1
fib N is (fib(N-1) + fib(N-2)) <4>

for I in 1..5 loop <5>
    F is fib I <6>
    print format("Fib(%1) is %2", I, F) <7>
....
<1> The `use` statements import global values defined in other
    files. Here, the `XL` module, its sub-module `XL.CONSOLE`, and a
    third-level sub-module `XL.CONSOLE.TEXT_IO` are all imported by
    the first statement, and similarly, `XL.TEXT` and `XL.TEXT.FORMAT`
    are added by the second statement (`XL` being already imported)
<2> The declaration of `print` is a global value link:#print[defined]
    in `XL.CONSOLE.TEXT_IO`. This `print` statement is the first thing
    to be executed during program evaluated. Its evaluation will call
    code for an implementation of `print`, thereby adding a new
    context on the call stack. As we indicated
    link:#print_instances[earlier], this may involve further calls
    making the call stack deeper.
<3> The three definitions with `fib` as a prefix are three distinct
    global values, even if, thanks to dynamic dispatch, they may be
    considered as implementing a single entity. Evaluating `fib N` or
    `fib I` may require considering all three global values as
    candidates.
<4> The evaluation of the expression `(fib(N-1)+fib(N-2))` will need
    to create a number of temporaries, for example to compute `N-1` or
    `N-2`. Temporaries may be link:#destruction[destroyed] as soon as
    they are no longer needed. For example, the code to evaluate the
    expression could be someting similar to the following code, where
    `tmp1`, `tmp2`, `tmp3`, `tmp4` and `tmp5` are the required
    temporaries:
+
[source]
----
tmp1 is N-1
tmp2 is fib(tmp1)
delete tmp1
tmp3 is N-2
tmp4 is fib(tmp3)
delete tmp3
tmp5 is tmp2+tmp4
delete tmp2
delete tmp4
tmp5
----
<5> The `for` loop creates a local variable named `I` that will
    successively take values `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`. The value for
    `I` will only be live within one iteration of the loop. In other
    words, the execution will be identical to the following
    (using a link:#closure[closure] for the different values of `I`):
+
[source]
----
tmpBody is
    F is fib I
    print format("Fib(%1) is %2", I, F)
{ I is 1 } ( tmpBody )
{ I is 2 } ( tmpBody )
{ I is 3 } ( tmpBody )
{ I is 4 } ( tmpBody )
{ I is 5 } ( tmpBody )
----
<6> The value defined by `F is fib I` is a local value that will be
    live for the duration of the evaluation of the enclosing block. It
    will be destroyed the end of each block. In other words, a more
    accurate description for `tmpBody` in the example above would have
    a `delete F` statement at the end, as follows:
+
[source]
----
tmpBody is
    F is fib I
    print format("Fib(%1) is %2", I, F)
    delete F
----
<7> It may come as a suprise to people coming from C or C++ that XL
    does not _require_ the call to `fib I` to be done before this
    point. The definition `F is fib I` can be read as either a
    constant initialized with `fib I`, or as a function returning `fib I`.
    If the compiler can determine that the result of calling
    evaluating `F` will always be identical, it is allowed to
    implement memoization, i.e. to store the value computed for `F`
    the first time, for example in an expression like `F+F`.

NOTE: Typically, a good compiler also makes use of machine
_registers_, very fast storage in the processor itself, as a cache for
values that are logically part of the call stack. In general, we will
only talk about the stack, with the understanding that this includes
registers where applicable.

==== Creation

_Creation_(((creation))) is the process of preparing a value for use.
The XL language rules guarantee that values are never undefined while
the value is live, by calling programmer-supplied code at the
appropriate times.

The ((lifetime)) of a value `V` begins by implicitly evaluating
a _((creation))_statement `create V`. This happens in particular
if you create a local variable without initializing it.

For example, consider the following code:

....
Add Z:complex is
   T:complex
   Z+T
....

The code above is really equivalent to the following, where the
implicitly-generated code has been put between parentheses:

....
Add Z:complex is
   T:complex
   (create T)
   Z+T
....

Values in link:#generic-containers[containers] receive well-defined
values through creation. For example, if you create an `array[1..5] of complex`,
the 5 `complex` values are created before you can access them.

[[field-creation]]
A `create` operation must take a single `out` argument. All the values
in this `out` argument are themselves created before the body of the
definition begins. For example, consider the following:

....
create Z:out complex is
    print "Creator called"
....

This code does not lead to uninitialized values, because it is really
equivalent to the following:

....
create Z:out complex is
   (create Z.Re)        // Implicit creation of complex fields
   (create Z.Im)
   print "Creator called"
....

The `create` operator for link:#basic-types[basic types] is said to
_((zero initialize))_ them as follows:

* `type` and `nil` values receive `nil`.
* All integer types receive value `0`
* All character types receive `character 0`.
* `text` receive `""`.
* `boolean` receive `false`.

The `create` operation can be called by the programmer, and therefore
must behave correctly if it is called multiple times. This is true by
default because of the rule that `out` parameters are
link:#destruction[destroyed] before a call.

For example, if you explicitly call `create` as in the following code:

....
Z:complex
create Z
....

this is really equivalent to the following, where implicit statements
are between parentheses:

....
Z:complex
(create Z)      // because of the declaration above
(delete Z)      // because Z is passed as out argument to 'create'
create Z
....

The compiler may be able to elide some of these calls in such cases.
Another important case where a compiler should elide creation calls is
called _((construction))_, and is based on the shape defined for types.
When you define a type, you need to specify the associate shape. For
example, we defined a `complex` type as follows:

[source]
----
type complex is matching complex(Re:real, Im:real)
----

This means that a shape like `complex(2.3, 5.6)` is a `complex`. This
also means that the _only_ elementary way to create a `complex` is by
creating such a shape. It is therefore not possible to have an
uninitialized element in a `complex`, since for example `complex(1.3)`
would not match the shape and not have the right type.

Using the shape explicitly given for the type is called the
_constructor_ for the type, and can be used in definitions or in
variable declarations with an initial value. A constructor can never
fail nor build a partial object. If an argument returns an
link:#errors[error] during evaluation, then that `error` value will
not match the expected argument, except naturally if the constructor
is written to accept `error` values.

Often, developers will offer alternate ways to create values of a given
type. These alternate helpers are nothing else than regular definitions
that return a value of the type.

For example, for the `complex` type, you may create an imaginary unit,
`i`, but you need a constructor to define it. You can also recognize
common expressions such as `2+3i` and turn them into constructors.

2 + 3i + 5          // Error: Two implicit conversions (exercise: fix it)
----

The fact that the only elementary way to create a type is through the
constructor is illustrated by the following code:

....
type large is matching (N when N > 42)
A:large := 44   // OK
B:large := 99.1 // OK
C:large         // Error
create V:out large is
    print "Creator called"
....

The `A:large` and `B:large` initializations are acceptable, because it
is possible to validate that the initial values match the `large`
pattern. The `C:large` definition, however, is not acceptable, despite
the presence of a `create` operation. The reason is that there is no
way to `create V.N`, first because the type to use cannot be deduced,
second because if we picked a type like `integer`, the default initial
value `0` would not match the pattern.

The code above can be fixed, however, by using a constructor for the
`large` type inside the creator, which means supplying a value that
matches the type's pattern. The following is an acceptable version of
the `create` function:

....
large is matching (N when N > 42)
C:large         // OK
create V:out large is
    print "Creator called"
    V := 44     // Creator for a large value
....

A type implementation may be _hidden_ in a
link:#modules[module interface], in which case the module
interface should also provide some functions to create elements of the
type. The following example illustrates this for a `file` interface
based on Unix-style file descriptors:

[[my_file]]
[source]
----
MY_FILE as module with
    file as type
    open(Name:text) as file
    close F:io file

MY_FILE as module is
    type file is matching file(fd:integer)
    open(Name:text) as file is
        fd:integer := libc.open(Name, libc.O_RDONLY)
        file(fd)
    close F:inout file is
        if fd >= 0 then
            libc.close(F.fd)
            F.fd := -2
    delete F:inout file is close F    // Destruction, see below
----

If the interface provides a `create` operation, it must be ready to
accept default-created values as input in all other functions of the
module. In the module above, however, the only way to get a value of
the `file` type is by using the `open` function. This also means that
you cannot create a variable of type `file` without initializing it.

NOTE: *RATIONALE* This mechanism is similar to _elaboration_ in Ada or to
_constructors_ in {cpp}. It makes it possible for programmers to provide
strong guarantees about the internal state of values before they can be
used. This is a fundamental brick of programming techniques such as
encapsulation, programming contracts or
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization[RAII].

==== Destruction

(((destruction)))
When the ((lifetime)) of a value `V` terminates, the statement `delete V`
automatically evaluates. Declared entites are destroyed in the reverse
order of their declaration. A `delete X:T` definition is called a
_((destructor))_ for type `T`. It often has an link:#inout[inout] parameter
for the value to destroy, in order to be able to modify its argument,
i.e. a destructor often has a signature like `delete X:inout T`.

Symmetrical to link:#field-creation[creation], the body of a `delete V`
automatically invokes `delete V.X` for any field `X` in `V` at exit of
the body of the definition.

For example, consider the definition below:

....
delete Z:inout complex is
    print "Deleting complex ", Z
....

That definition is actually equivalent to the definition below:
....
delete Z:inout complex is
    print "Deleting complex ", Z
    (delete Z.Im)
    (delete Z.Re)
....

There is a built-in default definition of that statement that has no
effect and matches any value, and which only deletes the fields:

....
delete Anything is nil
....

There may be multiple destructors that match a given expression. When
this happens, normal lookup rules happen. This means that, unlike
languages like {cpp}, a programmer can deliberately override the
destruction of an object, and remains in control of the destruction
process. More importantly, this means that the destruction process
respects the global type semantics.

Consider for example the deletion of the `file` type defined in the
`MY_FILE` module above. Since there is a special case for negative
values, that might be reflected in the implementation as follows:

....
delete F:inout file when F.fd < 0  is ... // Invalid flie
delete F:inout file                is ... // Valid file
....

However, this also means that the programmer could create a
`valid_file` type corresponding to the case where `F.fd<0` is false.
If you have a `valid_file` value to `delete`, normal type system and
lookup rules ensure that the second case will be selected.

[[field-destruction]]
Consider another interesting example, where you have the following
declarations:

....
type positive is matching (N when N > 0)
integers is string of integer
N:integers > 0 as boolean is
    for I in N loop
        if not (I > 0) then
            return false
    return true

delete N:inout positive is
    print "Deleting positive: ", N

delete N:integer is
    print "Deleting integer: ", N

delete N:integers is
    print "Deleting integers with size: ", size N

example is
   print "Beginning example"
   A:integers := string(1,8,4)
   B:integers := string(-1,0,5)
   print "End of example"
....

In this example, we create an `integers` type based on `string of integers`,
for which we implement the `N>0` operator to mean that all elements
in the `string` are positive. This in turn means that some values that
have type `integers` also have type `positive`. In the body of
`example`, `A` is `positive`, but `B` is not.

If one consider link:#implicit-inheritance[implicit inheritance] and
the implicitly inserted field destruction, the code for the `integers`
type and `delete` operations above is really equivalent to the following:

....
type integers is matching(base:string of integer)

delete P:inout positive is
    print "Deleting positive: ", P
    (delete P.N)        // Delete the N bound in 'positive'

delete N:integer is
    print "Deleting integer: ", N
    (delete N.base)     // For 'integer', this is a no-op

delete S:integers is
    print "Deleting integers with size: ", size S
    (delete S.base)     // Delete the underlying 'string of integer'
....

As a result, the output of this program should be something like:

....
Beginning example
End of example
Deleting integers with size 3 <1>
Deleting positive: 5 <2>
Deleting integer: 5 <3>
Deleting integer: 0 <4>
Deleting integer: -1
Deleting positive: string(1,8,4) <5>
Deleting integers with size 3 <6>
Deleting positive: 4
Deleting integer: 4
Deleting positive: 8
Deleting integer: 8
Deleting positive: 1
Deleting integer: 1
....
<1> This is deleting local variable `B` using type `integers`, knowing
    that it failed to pass the test for `positive` because of value `-1`.
<2> This is deleting values in the `string of integer` container in
    local variable `B`, starting with the last one. Containers can
    destroy their values in any order, but for `string`, an efficient
    algorithm may start with the end of the container in order to be
    able to truncate before each element being removed simply by
    changing a "number of items" in the `string`. The local `delete`
    definitions are visible to the instantiation of `delete` for the
    type `string of integer` that is made for the call at the end of
    `example`. The first matching definition for value `5` is for the
    `positive` type.
<3> This is implicitly deleting the `integer` value called `P.N` in
    the code above.
<4> For value `0` in the `string of integer` value held in `B`, the
    `positive` test failed, so that the first destructor that works is
    for `integer`.
<5> This is deleting local variable `A`. Since `A` is positive, the
    destructor for positive is called.
<6> Unlike what happened for `B`, the destructor for `integers` is not
    called directly for `B` but implicitly for `P.N`.

It is possible to create ((local destructor)) definitions. When such a local
definition exists, it is possible for it to override a more general
definition. The general definition can be accessed using
link:#enclosing context[`super` lookup], and generally, it should in order to
preserve the language semantics.

[source]
----
show_destructors is
    delete Something is
        print "Deleted", Something
        super.delete Something
    X is 42
    Y is 57.2
    X + Y
----

This should output something similar to the following:

[source]
----
Deleted 42.0
Deleted 57.2
Deleted 42
----

The first value being output is the ((temporary value)) created by the
necessary implicit conversion of `X` from `integer` to `real`. Note that
additional temporary values may appear depending on the optimizations
performed by the compiler. The value returned by the function should not
be destroyed, since it’s passed to the caller.

Any destruction code must be able to be called multiple times with the
same value, if only because you cannot prevent a programmer from
writing:

[source]
----
delete Value
----

In that case, `Value` will be destroyed twice, once by the explicit
`delete`, and a second time when `Value` goes out of scope. There is
obviously no limit on the number of destructions that an object may go
through.

....
for I in 1..LARGE_NUMBER loop
    delete Value
....

Also, remember that passing a value as an `out` argument implicitly
destroys it. This is in particular the case for the target of an
assignment.

==== Errors

Errors in XL(((error))) are represented by values with the `error`
type, or any type that link:#inheritance[inherits] from
error. The error type has a constructor that takes a simple error
message, or a simple message and a payload.:

[source]
----
error as type is one_of
    error Message:text
    error Message:text, Payload
----

The message is typically a localizable format text taking elements in
the payload as numbered argument in a way similar to the
link:#text-format[`format` function]:

....
log X:real as error when X <= 0 is
    error "Logarithm of negative value %1", X
....

A function that may fail will often have a `T or error` return value.
There is a specific shortcut for that, `mayfail T`:

[source]
----
mayfail T:type as type is T or error
----

For example, a logarithm returns an error for non-positive values, so
that the signature of the `log` functions is:

[source]
----
log X:real as mayfail real     is ... // May return real or error
----

If possible, error detection should be pushed to the interface of the
function. For the `log` function, it is known to fail only for negative
or null values, so that a better interface would be:

[source]
----
log X:real as real  when X > 0.0    is ... // Always return a real
log X:real as error                 is ... // Always return an error
----

With the definitions above, the type of `log X` will be `real` if it
is known that `X > 0.0`, `error` if it is known that the condition is
false, and `real or error`, i.e. `mayfail real`, in the more general case.
A benefit of writing code this way is that the compiler can more easily
figure out that the following code is correct and does not require any
kind of error handling:

[source]
----
if X > 0.0 then
    print format("Log(%1) is %2", X, log X)
----

NOTE: *RATIONALE* By returning an `error` for ((failure)) conditions,
XL forces the programmer to deal with errors simply to satisfy the
((type system)). They cannot simply be ignored like C return values or
{cpp} ((exception))s can be. Errors that may possibly return from a
function are a fundamental part of its type, and error handling is not
optional.

A number of types link:#inheritance[derive] from the base `error` type
to feature additional properties:

* A `range_error`(((range error))) indicates that a given value is out
  of range. The default message provided is supplemented with
  information comparing the value with the expected range.
+
[source]
----
T:text[I:offset] as character or range_error is
    if I >= length T then
        range_error "Text index %2 is out of bounds for text %2", I, T
    else
        P : memory_address[character] := memory_address(T.first)
        P += I
        *P
----
* A `logic_error`(((logic error))) indicates an unexpected condition
  in the program, and can be returned by contract checks like `assert`,
  `require` and `ensure`.
+
[source]
----
if X > 0 then
    print "X is positive"
else if X < 0 then
    print "X is negative"
else
    logic_error "Some programmer forgot to consider this case"
----
* [[storage_error]]A `storage_error`(((storage error))) is returned whenever a
  link:#dynamic_value[dynamic value] is created, notably each time an
  `own T` object is created, but also when additional storage is
  needed for containers.
+
....
S : string of integer           // The string requires storage
loop
    V : own integer := 3        // This allocates an integer, freed each loop
    S &= V                      // Accumulate integers in an unbounded way
....
* A `file_error`(((file error))) reports when there is an error
  opening a file, for example because a file does not exist.
* A `permission_error`(((permission error))) reports when a resource
  access is denied, whether it's a file or any other resource.
* A `compile_error`(((compile error))) helps the compiler emit better
  diagnostic for situations which would lead to an invalid program. All
  errors can be emitted at compile-time if the compiler can detect that
  they will occur unconditionally, but `compile_error` makes it clearer
  that this is intended to detect an error at compile-time. A variant,
  `compile_warning`, emits a message but lets the compilation proceed.
+
[source]
----
// Emit a specific compile-time error if assigning text to an integer
X:integer := Y:text is
    compile_error "Cannot assign text %1 to integer %2", Y, X

// Emit a specific warning when writing a real into an integer
X:integer := Y:real is
    compile_warning "Assigning real to integer may lose data"
    T is integer Y
    if real T = Y then
        X := T
    else
        range_error "Assigned real value %1 is out of range for integer", Y
----

==== Mutability

A value is said to be _mutable_ if it can change during its lifetime. A
value that is not mutable is said to be _constant_. A mutable named
entity is called a _variable_. An immutable named entity is called a
_named constant_.

The `X:T` type annotations indicates that `X` is a mutable value of type
`T`, unless type `T` is explicitly marked as constant. When `X` is a
name, the annotation declares that `X` is a variable. The `X as T` type
annotation indicates that `X` is a constant value of type `T`, unless
type `T` is explicitly marked as variable. When `X` is a name, this may
declare either a named constant or a function without parameters,
depending on the shape of the body.

[source]
----
StartupMessage : text := "Hello World"  // Variable
Answer as integer is 42                 // Named constant
----

A mutable value can be initialized or modified using the `:=` operator,
which is called an
link:##assignments-and-moves[_assignment_].
There are a number of derived operators, such as `+=`, that combine a
frequent arithmetic operation and an assignment.

[source]
----
X : integer := 42       // Initialize with value 42
X := X or 1             // Binary or, X is now 43
X -= 1                  // Subtract 1 from X, now 42
----

Some entities may give link:#access-types[access] to individual inner values.
For example, a `text` value is conceptually made of a number of
individual `character` values that can be accessed individually. This is
true irrespective of how `text` is represented. In addition, a `slice` of
a `text` value is itself a `text` value. The mutability of a `text`
value obviously has an effect on the mutability of accessed elements in
the `text`.

The following example shows how `text` values can be mutated directly
(1), using a computed assignment (2), by changing a slice (3) or by
changing an individual element (4).

[source]
----
Greeting : text := "Hello"              // Variable text
Person as text is "John"                // Constant text
Greeting := Greeting & " " & Person     // (1) Greeting now "Hello John"
Greeting &= "!"                         // (2) Greeting now "Hello John!"
Greeting[0..4] := "Good m0rning"        // (3) Greeting now "Good m0rning John!"
Greeting[6] := 'o'                      // (4) Greeting now "Good morning John!"
----

None of these operations would be valid on a constant text such as
`Person` in the code above. For example, `Person[3]:='a'` is invalid,
since `Person` is a constant value.

NOTE: In the case (3) above, modifying a `text` value through an access
type can change its length. This is possible because `Greeting[0..4]` is
not an independent value, but an access type, specifically a `slice`,
which keeps track of both the `text` (`Greeting` here) and the index
range (`0..4` in that case), with a `:=` operator that modifies the
accessed `text` value.

A constant value does not change over its lifetime, but it may change
over the lifetime of the program. More precisely, the lifetime of a
constant is at most as long as the lifetime of the values it is computed
from. For example, in the following code, the constant `K` has a
different value for every interation of the loop, but the constant `L`
has the same value for all iterations of `I`

[source]
----
for J in 1..5 loop
    for I in 1..5 loop
        K is 2*I + 1
        L is 2*J + 1
        print "I=", I, " K=", K, " L=", L
----

NOTE: *RATIONALE* There is no syntactic difference between a constant and a
function without parameters. An implementation should be free to
implement a constant as a function if this is more effective, or to use
smarter strategies when appropriate.

==== Compactness

Some data types can be represented by a fixed number of contiguous
memory locations. This is the case for example of `integer` or `real`:
all `integer` values take the same number of bytes. Such data types are
called _compact_.

On the other hand, a `text` value can be of any length, and may
therefore require a variable number of bytes to represent values such as
`"Hi"` and
`"There once was a time where text was represented in languages such as Pascal by fixed-size character array with a byte representing the length. This meant that you could not process text that was longer than, say, 255 characters. More modern languages have lifted this restriction."`.
These values are said to be _scattered_.

Scattered types are always built by _interpreting_ compact types. For
example, a representation for text could be made of two values, the
memory address of the first character, and the size of the text. This is
not the only possible representation, of course, but any representation
require interpreting fixed-size memory locations and giving them a
logical structure.

Although this is not always the case, the assignment for compact types
generally does a link:#copy[copy], while the assignment for scattered
types typically does a link:#move[move].

==== Ownership

Computers offer a number of _((resource))s_: memory, files, locks,
network connexions, devices, sensors, actuators, and so on. A common
problem with such resources is to control their _((ownership))_. In
other words, who is responsible for a given resource at any given
time.

In XL, like in languages like Rust or {cpp}, ownership is largely
determined by the type system, and relies heavily on the guarantees it
provides, in particular with respect to link:#creation[creation] and
link:#destruction[destruction]. In {cpp}, the mechanism is called
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAII[((RAII))], which stands for _((Resource
Acquisition is Initialization))_. The central idea is that ownership of a
resource is an ((invariant)) during the lifetime of a value. In other words,
the value gets ownership of the resource during ((construction)), and
releases this ownership during ((destruction)). This was illustrated in the
`file` type of the module `MY_FILE` link:#my_file[given earlier].

Types designed to own the associated value are called _owner types_.
There is normally at most one live owner at any given time for each
controlled resource, that acquired the resource at construction time,
and will release it at destruction time. It may be possible to release
the owned resource early using `delete Value`.

The link:#standard-library[((standard library))] provides a
number of types intended to own common classes of resources, including:

* An `own` value owns a single item allocated in dynamic storage.
  Note that the value `nil` is not a valid `own` value (except for
  `own nil`). If you need `nil` as a value, you must use `own T or nil`.
* An `array`, a `buffer` and a `string` all own a contiguous sequence of
  items of the same type.
** An `array` has a fixed size during its lifetime and allocates items
  directly, e.g. on the execution stack.
** A `buffer` has a fixed size during its lifetime, and allocates items
  dynamically, typically from a heap.
** A `string` has a variable size during its lifetime, and consequently
  may move items around in memory as a result of specific operations.
* A `text` owns a variable number of `character` items, and inherits
  from the `string of character` type.
* A `file` owns an open file.
* A `mutex` owns execution by a single thread while it’s live.
* A `timer` owns a resource that can be used to measure time and
  schedule execution.
* A `thread` owns an execution thread and the associated call stack.
* A `task` owns an operation to perform that can be dispatched to one of
  the available threads of execution.
* A `process` owns an operating system process, including its threads
  and address space.
* A `context` captures an execution context.

==== Access types

Not all types are intended to be owner types. Many types delegate
ownership to another type. Such types are called _((access type))s_.
When an access type is destroyed, the resources that it accesses are
_not_ disposed of, since the access type does not own the value. A
value of the acces type merely provides _access_ to a particular value
of the associated ((owner type)).

For example, if `T` is a `text` value and if `A` and `B` are `integer`
values, then `T[A..B]` is a particular kind of access value called a
_slice_, which denotes the fragment of text between `0`-based positions
`A` and `B`. By construction, slice `T[A..B]` can only access `T`, not
any other `text` value. Similarly, it is easy to implement bound checks
on `A` and `B` to make sure that no operation ever accesses any
`character` value outside of `T`. As a result, this access value is
perfectly safe to use.

Access types generalize _((pointers))_ or _((references))_ found in
other languages, because they can describe a much wider class of
access patterns. A pointer can only access a single element, whereas
access types have no such restriction, as the `T[A..B]` example
demonstrates.  Access types can also enforce much stricter ((ownership))
rules than mere pointers.

NOTE: The C language worked around the limitation that pointers access
a single element by abusing so-called "((pointer arithmetic))", in
particular to implement arrays. In C, `A[I]` is merely a shortcut for
`*(A+I)`. This means that `3[buffer]` is a valid way in C to access the
third element of `buffer`, and that there are scenarios where `ptr[-1]`
also makes sense as a way to access the element that precedes `ptr`.
Unfortunately, this hack, which may have been cute when machines had 32K
of memory, is now the root cause of a whole class of programming errors
known as _((buffer overflow))s_, which contribute in no small part to the
well-deserved reputation of C as being a language that offers no ((memory
safety)) whatsoever.

The link:#standard-library[((standard library))] provides a
number of types intended to access common owner types, including:

* A `ref` is a reference to a live `own` value.
* A `slice` can be used to access range of items in contiguous
  sequences, including `array`, `buffer` or `string` (and therefore
  `text` considered as a `string of character`).
* A `reader` or a `writer` can be used to access a `file` either for
  reading or writing.
* A `lock` takes a `mutex` to prevent multiple threads from executing a
  given piece of code.
* Several types such as `timing`, `dispatch`, `timeout` or `rendezvous`
  will combine `timer`, `thread`, `task` and `context` values.
* The `in`, `out` and `inout` type expressions can sometimes be
  equivalent to an access types if that is the most efficient way to pass
  an argument around. However, this is mostly invisible to the programmer.
* An `XL.SYSTEM.MEMORY.address` references a specific address in
  memory, and is the closest there is in XL to a raw C pointer. It is
  purposely verbose and cumbersome to use, so as to discourage its use
  when not absolutely necessary.

==== Inheritance

A type is said to _inherit_(((inheritance))) another type, called its
_((base type))_, if it can use all its operations. The type is then
said to _derive_(((derived type))) from the base type. In XL, this is
achieved simply by providing an _((implicit conversion))_ between the
derived type and the base type:

[source]
----
Derived:derived as base is ...
----

As a consequence of this approach, a type can derive from any number of
other types, a feature sometimes called _((multiple inheritance))_. There is
also no need for the base(((base type))) and ((derived type)) to share
any specific ((data representation)), although this is
link:#data-inheritance[often done in practice]. For example, there is
an implicit conversion from `i16` to `i32`, altough the
machine representation is different, so in XL, one can say that
`i16` derives from `i32`.

Sometimes, it is necessary to denote a type that inherits from a
specific type. For example, if you want to create a ((constrained
generic type)) for `complex`, you might want it to accept only `number`
for its type argument. The following code is an incorrect way to do
it, since it creates a type that only accept `number` _values_ as an
argument, i.e. it would accept `complex[3.5]` but not `complex[real]`:

....
type complex is matching complex[real:number] // WRONG
....

To denote a type that derives from a base type, one can use the
`derived like base` notation. The correct way to implement the above
restriction is as follows, which indicates that the argument is a
type, not a value, and that the type must derive from `number`:

....
type complex is matching complex[real:type like number]
....

The precedence of `like` is lower than that of `:`, so that the above
really parses as `(real:type) like number`. The `like` operator can be
applied to specify inheritance at any place in a declaration, and
notably in scopes. An alternate spelling for `like` is `inherits`,
which is generally more readable in global scope. For example, you can
indicate that the `complex` type itself inherits from `arithmetic`
(providing arithmetic operations) as well as from `compact` (using a
contiguous memory range) as follows:

....
type complex inherits arithmetic
type complex inherits compact
....

=== Subtypes

A type can be given additional constraints(((type constraints))),
which define a _((subtype))_. A subtype can always be converted to the
type it was derived from, and therefore derives from that type in the
link:#inheritance[inheritance] sense. A subtype ((machine representation))
may differ from the type it derives from.

For example, from the `integer` type, one can construct a `month` type
that matches only `integer` values between `1` and `12` using a regular
link:#when[conditional pattern] as follows:

[source]
----
type month is matching(M:integer when M >= 1 and M <= 12)
----

The language defines a number of standard subtypes. All these subtypes
can be implemented using regular language features.

==== Range subtypes

Subtyping to select a range is common enough that there is a shortcut
for it. For any type with an order, subtypes can be created with the
`range` infix operator, creating a _((range subtype))_:

[source]
----
T:type range Low:T..High:T      is matching(X:T when X in Low..High)
----

With this definition, the `month` type can be defines simply as follows:

[source]
----
type month is integer range 1..12
----

==== Size subtypes

The infix `bits` operator creates a _((size subtype))_ with the
specified number of bits. It applies to `real`, `integer` and
`character` types.

For example, the `i8` type can be defined as:

[source]
----
type i8 is integer bits 8
----

This implicitly implies a `range` that depends on the type being
subtyped. For example, for `integer` and `natural`, the range would be
defined as follows:

[source]
----
[[integer]] bits N:natural      is integer range -2^(N-1)..2^(N-1)-1
[[natural]] bits N:natural      is natural range  0..2^N-1
----

NOTE: The `bits` subtypes are intended to specify the bit size of the
machine representation. The requested size may be rounded up to a more
convenient or more efficient machine representation. For example, on a
32-bit machine, `integer bits 22` might be more efficiently represented
as a 32-bit value in registers and as 3 bytes, i.e. 24 bits, in memory.

==== Real subtypes

The `real` type can be subtyped with a `range` and a `bits` size, as
well as with additional constraints more specific to the `real` type:

* a `digits` count specifies the number of accurate decimal digits,
  For example, `real digits 3` is represents values with at least 3
  significant digits.

* a `quantum` followed by a literal real value specifies a
  representation that should be representable exactly. For example,
  `real quantum 0.25` that value `0.25` must be represented exactly.

* an `exponent` specifies the maximum decimal exponent. For example,
  `real exponent 100` will ensure that values up to `1.0e100` can be
  represented.

* a `base` specifies the base for the internal representation. Only
  bases `2`, `10` and `16` are allowed. Base `2` requires a ((binary
  floating-point representation)). Base `10` requires a ((decimal
  floating-point representation)). Base `16` requires an ((hexadecimal
  floating-point representation)) on historical platforms that support it.

[WARNING]
====
In some cases, the types created using one of these operators may not
be subtypes of `real`. For example, on any machine using machine using
the most common floating-point representation available in hardware,
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE-754[IEEE-754], the value `0.01` cannot be
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#Representable_numbers,_conversion_and_rounding[represented accurately].
This means that an implicit conversion from `real quantum 0.01` to
`real` would implicitly destroy accuracy. As a result, `real quantum 0.01`
must be converted to `real` __explicitly__(((explicit conversion))).
In some other cases, ((implementation limitations)) may cause errors. For
example, an implementation is not required to accept `real digits
100`.
====

A `real` subtype should be represented using
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic[_((fixed-point
arithmetic))_] if one of the following conditions is true:

* The `exponent` is specified as `0`.
* The `range` is small enough to be representable entirely with the same
  exponent and the available number of bits.
* A `quantum` is specified and no `exponent` is specified.

For example, the `hundredth` type defined below could be represented
internally by an `natural` values between `0` and `100`, and converted to
`real` by multiplying this value by the given `quantum` value.

[source]
----
type hundredth is real range 0.0..1.0 quantum 0.01
----

==== Saturating subtypes

The `saturating` prefix operator can be used on `integer` and `real`
types (primarily intended for use with fixed-point subtypes) to select
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_arithmetic[_((saturation arithmetic))_]
in case of overflow.

For example, a `color_component` type that has values between `0.0`
and `1.0` and saturates can be defined as follows:

....
type color_component is saturating real range 0.0..1.0 bits 16
Red : color_component := 0.5
Red += 0.75             // Red is now 1.0
....

==== Character subtypes

The `character` types can be subtyped with the `range` and `bits`
operators:

....
letter is character range 'A'..'Z'
ASCII  is character bits 7
....

In addition, character types can be subtyped with the following infix
operators:

* The `encoding` operator specifies the encoding used for the text, for
  example `character encoding "ASCII"`.
* The `locale` operator specifies the locale for the text, for example
  `character locale "fr_FR"` will select a French locale.
* The `collation` operator specifies collating order. For example, to
  have `character` values that sort following German rules, you would use
  `character collation "de_DE"`


==== Text subtypes

The `text` type can be subtyped with the `encoding`, `locale` and
`collation` operators, with the same meaning as for `character`.

==== Memory access subtypes

[[atomic]]
Many recent machines provide several ways to access memory, for
example to deal with synchronization between multiple CPUs or between
CPUs and memory-mapped devices. XL presents this kind of features as
subtypes.

The following standard subtypes implement memory-related semantics:

* `atomic T` is a type derived from `T` that offers
  link:https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/atomic[atomic operations].
  This may come at the expense of performance.

* `unaligned T` is a type derived from `T` that may not respcet normal
  alignment rules, and may require slower mis-aligned accesses.

* `T aligned N` guarantees that values of type `T` use memory
  aligned on `N` bytes boundaries.

* `volatile T` is a type derived from `T` where the compiler cannot
  assume that the value does not change externally due to causes
  external to the current code.

* `uncached T` is a type derived from `T` where the compiler should
  ensure that data accesses are consistent with external memory, even
  if this is significantly more expensive.

* `packed T` is a type derived from `T` where data is packed as
  tightly as possible, even to the detriment of performance.

Additional subtypes may be available to match the features of the
machine the code runs on.

=== Type interface

[[field]][[method]]
The link:#interface-and-implementation[interface] of a type specifies
how the type can be used, and what operations can be performed with
it. Specifically, the interface defines:

* _((feature))s_ of the type, which are elements that are visible in
  the link:#pattern-matching-scope[scope] defined by a value of the type.
  link:#mutability[Mutable] features are sometimes called _fields_,
  whereas constant features are sometimes called _methods_.

* _((inheritance))_ of the type, which indicates what type, if any,
  the type link:#inheritance[derives from].

A feature is said to be _advertised_(((advertised feature))) if it is
explicitly and intentionally part of the interface. A feature is said
to be _exposed_(((exposed feature))) if it is made visible as an
unintentional or even undesirable side effect of the interface.
For example, if an implementation reqauires ((dynamic values)), this may
force the interface to expose the `storage_error` values that might be
generated as a result of out-of-memory conditions.

The code below defines a `picture` type that advertises `width`, `height`
and `pixels` fields, as well as an `area` method that is used to compute
the total number of pixels and is the size for the `pixels` buffer. In
this interface, one might argue that the fact that `pixels` is a
`buffer` falls more in the "exposed" category than "advertised".

[source]
----
type picture with
    width  : size
    height : size
    pixels : buffer[area] of byte
    area as size
----

The code below indicates that the type `text` derives from `string of
character` with additional features:

[source]
----
type text like [string of character] with
    byte_count as size                  // Number of bytes used by characters
    as_number[T:some number] as T       // Numerical conversion
----

An _abstract type_ is a type for which features or inheritance are not
provide. The only thing known about such a type is its name. In the
earlier `MY_FILE` link:#my_file[example], `file` was an abstract type defined
as folows:

....
file as type
....

A type for which only the interface is known is called a _((tag type))_.
Since nothing is known about the parse tree shape associated with the
type, a tag type can only match values that were _tagged_ with the
same type using some explicit type annotation.

In particular, knowing only the interface of a type does not allow
values of the type to be link:#creation[created]. It is sometimes
useful or desirable to preclude the creation of values of the type,
for example when creating link:#true-generic-types[true generic types].
For most concrete types, however, the interface of a function creating
values of the type should generally also be provided. In the rest of
the discussion for the `picture` type, we will assume that there is a
`picture` function returning a `picture` value with the following
function interface:

[source]
----
picture(width:size, height:size) as picture
----

==== Information hiding

The interface of a type does not reveal any information on the actual
implementation of the type, e.g. on the shape of the parse tree
associated with it. This is called _((information hiding))_ and
is the primary way in XL to achieve
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)[_((encapsulation))_].

While the type interface for `picture` above does not give us any clue
about how the type is actually implemented, it still provides very
useful information. It remains sufficient to validate code that uses
values of the type, like the following definition of `is_square`:

[source]
----
is_square P:picture is P.width = P.height
----

In that code, `P` is properly tagged as having the `picture` type, and
even if we have no idea how that type is implemented, we can still use
`P.width` and deduce that it’s an `integer` value based on the type
interface alone.

Information hiding is specially useful in the context of
link:#modules[modules], where the interface and implementation
typically reside in different source files.

==== Direct implementation

The simplest way to implement any feature of a type is to ensure that
the implementation of the type has a matching feature. This is called
a _((direct implementation))_ of the feature.

A feature is directly implemented by providing a definition for it in
the link:#pattern-matching-scope[pattern matching scope] for the type
implementation. In particular, the formal parameters for a
link:#creation[constructor] naturally provide a direct implementation
for the interface. For example, a constructor for type `picture` might
look like:

....
type picture is matching picture
    pixels : buffer[area] of u8
    width  : size
    height : size
....

In a scope where the implementation is known, if `P` is a `picture`,
we know that there is a pattern matching scope in `P` which contains
the bindings of the formal parameters to the argument values.
This pattern matching scope is where the binding, and therefore value
of `width` in `P.width` is found.

In a context where only the interface is visible, an expression like
`P.width` is known to be valid because we can look it up in the
interface for the `picture` type. However, in order to identify the
implementation for `P.width`, we must look this expression up in a
context where the implementation of `picture` is known. Finding an
implementation definition that matches the interface definition is the
mechanism underlying direct implementation of the feature.

==== Data inheritance

To implement inheritance, a direct implementation is to simply reuse
the existing data in the original type, possibly adding more to
it. This is called _((data inheritance))_, and is implemented by using
the `T with Fields` notation.

For example, using data inheritance to implement a `colored_text` that
derives from the `text` type and adds a color, the interface might be:

....
colored_text as some text with
    foreground : color
    background : color
....

An implementation using data inheritance would look like this:

....
colored_text is text with
   background : color
   foreground : color
....

As shown in the example, the fields need not be in the same order in
the implementation as in the interface. In the resulting
implementation type, a field named `base` refers to the base type on
the left of `with`. For values of that derived type, the field `base`
refers to the base value. Using data inheritance lets the translator
automatically generate implicit conversion code that takes a derived
value and returns its base. In our case, that implicit conversion
would look like this:

....
derived:colored_text as text is derived.base
....

Data inheritance can be used to inherit any scope. A particular idiom
is to inherit a generic module that implements shared features.
For example, in order to simplify the definition of a generic
`complex` type, one can write a generic module in which it is
called simply  `complex`:

....
COMPLEX[real:some number] as module with

    complex as some number
    X:complex + Y:complex as complex
    ...
....

A non-generic module can then build a generic type with all the
trimmings simply with:

....
COMPLEX as module with
    complex[real:some number] as some number is
        super.COMPLEX[real].complex with super.COMPLEX[real]
....

What this means in English is: `COMPLEX` is a `module` with a
`complex[real]` type that inherits `number`, where `real` is itself a
number, and that type is the `complex` type from the `COMPLEX[real]`
module in the enclosing scope, inheriting the entire scope of that
module.

The consequence of that idiom is that any use of `complex` from the
`COMPLEX` module will automatically inherit operations like the
addition which have been defined in the generic `COMPLEX[real]` module.


==== Indirect implementation

However, the implementation may be entirely different from the
interface, as long as any expression that is valid knowing the
interface is valid in a context where the implementation is known.
An implementation that provides an advertised feature of the interface
withtout using a similar definition is called an _((indirect implementation))_
of that feature.

A simple case of indirect implementation for inheritance is to provide
an implicit conversion function. For example, the implementation of
`text` may simply be defined in a scope that also features the
following function:

....
T:text as string of character is convert_to_string(T)
....

While it is reasonable to infer from the interface that `text` and
`string of character` might share a common internal representation,
this is only an efficient way to provide inheritance, but it is not a
constraint on the implementation.

A type may also provide entirely different implementations of its
features, while still allowing individual features to be accessed
almost as if they were provided by a direct implementation. We will
see a number of examples in the next sections.

==== Delegation

An interesting case is when the type _delegates_(((delegation))) most
of its implementation to some other type. For example, the `picture`
type might actually be using a `bitmap` type as its internal
representation:

....
type bitmap with
    width  : u16
    height : u16
    buf    : array[width, height] of u8
type picture is matching picture
    bits:bitmap
....

Such an implementation of the `picture` type must perform some serious
adjustments in order to delegate the work to the underlying `bitmap`
value while providing the expected interface. Dealing with the `width`
and `height` fields seems relatively straightforward:

[source]
----
type picture is matching picture
    bits:bitmap

    width  is bits.width
    height is bits.height
----

This, however, will not work as is, because we have only provided a
way to _read_ `width` and `height`, not to write it. This does not
match the interface. A simple solution would be to modify the
`picture` interface, for example so that it reads `width as size`.
With this interface change, the code above will correctly allow us to
find an implementation for expressions such as `P.width`.

==== Attributes implementation

If, however, we still want to be able to _write_ into `width` and
`height`, the implementation must provide a way to assign to the field.
The first problem here is with the notation that properly identifies
this operation. The following for example does not work:

[source]
----
type picture is matching picture
    bits:bitmap

    width  is bits.width
    height is bits.height

    width  := W is bits.width := W
    height := H is bits.width := H
----

The reason it does not work is that `width` in the `width := W`
pattern is a formal parameter. The link:#metabox[metabox] solution
does not work in that context, since writing `+[[width]] := W+` would
match the _value_ of `width`, not its shape, and unless `width` is
defined as `self` like `true` or `false` can be, attempting to
evaluate `width` will not achieve the desired effect.

It is possible to resort to a more convoluted solution that intercepts
assignments to `width` and height by using `type(width)` as a way to
only match `width`, which leads to somewhat inelegant and unreadable
code like:

[source]
----
type picture is matching picture
    bits:bitmap

    width  is bits.width
    height is bits.height

    width:type(width)   := W    is      bits.width := W
    height:type(height) := H    is      bits.width := H
----

To avoid this issue, XL provides a helper generic type called
`attribute T`, which helps implementing an
link:#attributes[_((attribute))_] of the desired type. An `attribute T`
behaves like a `T` that provides `get` and `set` features, as well as
support for assignments. The implementation for the `picture` type
type can be correctly written as follows:

[source]
----
type picture is matching picture
    bits:bitmap

    width as attribute[size] is attribute
        get     is bits.width
        set W   is bits.width := W
    height as attribute[size] is attribute
        get     is bits.height
        set H   is bits.height := H
----

If `P` is a `picture`, then the `width` value can be read using
`P.width` or `P.width.get`, and written to using `P.width := W`,
`P.width.set W` or `P.width W`. The best method will depend on the use
case. In any case, an `attribute T` can be used to implement a field
of type `T` declared in the interface.

==== Generic implementations

By providing as little type information as possible, the code as
written above remains as generic as possible. This enables better
optimizations. For instance, writing `width 320` might generate only
code for `u16` without any need for any `size` value to be
ever created.

Unfortunately, that code will only be accepted by the compiler until
you try to use it with values that do not fit within an `u16`.
It is accepted because it is not typed, therefore generic, so that
some errors cannot be detected until you instantiate it.
Furthermore, no error will be generated if the values being passed all
fit within an `u16`.

If `P` is a `picture`, then `P.width 320` will work, but `P.width
1_000_000` will not, since that value is out of range for
`u16`. This is problematic because it is quite likely that the
attribute will receive some unknown `size` value. After all, the
interface was designed for an `sie`, not an `u16`, so it
makes sense to invoke it with values of this type. There will be an
error in that case, because nothing in our code accepts a `size`
value that does not fit in the `u16` subtype.

==== Attribute error checking

This can also be fixed, but if we want to do it correctly, we need to
range-check the input. One cheap and lazy way to do it is to ignore
bad input and just print some run-time error.

[source]
----
type picture is matching picture
    bits:bitmap

    width as attribute[size] is
        get             is bits.width
        set W:u16       is bits.width := W
        set W           is
             print error("Invalid picture width %1", W
             bits.width
    height as attribute[size] is
        get             is bits.height
        set H:u16       is bits.height := H
        set H           is
            print error("Invalid picture height %1", H)
            bits.height
----

If we instead want to return the error, then we need to expose the
error in the interface, for example:

[source]
----
type picture with
    width  : mayfail size
    height : mayfail size
    pixels : buffer[area] of byte
    area as size
----

That, however, suggests that `width` might accept `error` values as
input. A better interface would be to expose the attribute nature of
`width` and `height`:

[source]
----
type picture with
    width  as attribute size
    height as attribute size
    pixels : buffer[area] of byte
    area as size
----

But if we are going that way, we may as well expose the simpler
interface that does not lie about the underlying values:

[source]
----
tyep picture with
    width  : u16
    height : u16
    pixels : buffer[area] of byte
    area as size is width * height
----

These various examples show that XL provides powerful tools that makes
it possible to evolve software significantly without having to change
the interface, preserving compatibility for client code. However,
information hiding can never be perfect. The XL type system will catch
a large number of errors and force you to deal with them, giving you
several ways to safely evolve the code.

==== Exposed details

A similar, if slightly more complicated problem arises with the
proposed interface for `pixels` in the `picture` type, because
`buffer` is a type that may require dynamic allocation, and therefore
some operations may have to return a `storage_error`. This is already
present in the interface for the `buffer` type, so one might feel a
bit safer than for the mismatch between `size` and `u16`.

However, since there is no actual `buffer` present in `bitmap`, a
buffer may need to be created or at least given storage in the
implementation of `P.pixels` for `picture` values.
This may involve the _creation_ of a buffer while simply
reading a field. In other words, a `storage_error` may now result from
apparently _reading_ `P.pixels`, something that would not
happen with a direct implementation of `P.pixels` as a field.

In other words, in an ideal world, `P.pixels` might be implemented as
an actual buffer or as a function computing a buffer and returning
it. In the real world, however, the XL type system will force you to
distinguish between the two cases, because the place where dynamic
allocations may fail is different depending on the chosen implementation.

In that case too, the interface may need to be changed to expose an
implementation detail regarding when the buffer is actually created.
It might seem like an inability of XL to offer sufficient information
hiding capabilities, but in reality, it's a testament to the power of
the XL type system that it should catch such subtle errors, even if it
is at the cost of convenience. XL will accept to hide details as long
as these details are not critical for safe evaluation. The details
that will not be hidden in that case are what might cause your program
to crash or your rocket to explode.

=== Transfers

One of the most important operation that can happen to values of any
type is to _((transfer))_ them around in the program. These operations
are so crucial to the behavior of the program that XL provides a
number of ways to define and optimize them.
In particular, transfers interact with the link:#ownership[ownership]
guarantees that the language may provide, in combination with the rules
about link:#lifetime[lifetime], link:#creation[creation] and
link:#destruction[destruction]. Additionally, they are so frequent
that it is necessary to consider performance of transfers, which is
one reason why there are two flavors, link:#copy[copy] and
link:#move[move].

==== Assignments

As was link:#assignment[already discussed], an _((assignment))_ is the
primary way for a programmer to explicitly transfer values from one
context to another. The `:=` operator is used in XL to represent
assignments.

For example, the following code implements the core computation of a
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set[Julia set]:

....
julia_depth(Z:complex, Mu:complex, Bound:real, Max:count) as count is
    while result < Max and Z.Re^2 + Z.Im^2 < Bound ^2 loop
        result := result + 1
        Z := Z^2 - Mu
....

This code contains two assignments, one to `result`, the
link:#implicit-result-variable[implicit variable] holding the return
value, and one to `Z`. The assignment `result := result + 1` updates
the variable `result` with the next `count` value. This kind of
assignment combined with a simple operation is so frequent that there
are link:#operator_assignment[shortcut notations] for it, and you
could write `result += 1` to achieve the same effect.

An assignment is a shortcut for either a link:#copy[copy] of the
value, which is the case in the code above, or a link:#move[move] when
a copy would be unreasonably expensive. In general, using the
assignment operator is the safe choice, since it will automatically
select the most efficient operation for you based on the type.

When you create a new type, you get to choose if the assignment
operator for that type gets to perform a copy or a move. For example,
for `complex` we may want a copy, and for `picture` we may want a move
because there is a lot of data. This would be implemented as follows:

....
Target:out complex := Source:complex    is Target :+ Source     // Copy
Target:out picture := Source:picture    is Target :< Source     // Move
....

==== Copy

A _((copy))_ is a kind of transfer which creates a new, "identical",
yet independent value. The new value can then be modified
independently from the original, and has a different lifetime.
XL uses either the prefix `copy` function or the infix `Target :+
Source` as a notation for a copy, the `+` in that operator being a
reminder that a new copy is created.

The copy operation has the following mandatory interface for all types:

....
Target:out T :+ Source:T as mayfail T
copy Source:T as mayfail T is result :+ Source
....

The copy returns the `Target` after it has been copied into, or an
`error` value if there was some failure. When it returns a failure,
any value that may have been created as part of the copy must
have been link:#destruction[deleted] by the copy operation.

The new copied value is link:#creation[created] by the operator, and
should be identical in its behavior to the source. It needs not be
identical in its internal representation. For example, if you copy a
`picture` type, the content of the `pixels` buffer, i.e. the values
that it contains, should be identical to the original, but the binary
representation for the `pixels` field itself will be different, since
it will refer to a new buffer in memory.

Some types may have a complex hierarchical structure, with several
layers of values referencing one another. For example, a `tree`
structure may have some arbitrarily nested branches. In such a case,
the copy operator should perform what is known as a _((deep copy))_,
in other words make sure that the new value has ownership of all the
elements it refers to, independently from the source value.

In some cases, it is important to also feature a _((shallow copy))_
operation, which only copies up to a certain point. Since the
condition for stopping the copy are highly dependent on the type, it
is not possible to provide a single unified interface that would work
for all types. However, as far as possible, such operation should have
an interface that looks like the following:

....
copy (Source:T, StopConditions) as mayfail T
....

For example, the shallow copy for a tree could have the following
interface, where either a depth or a `node_filter` :

....
copy(Source:tree, Depth:count) as mayfail T
copy(Source:tree, Keep:node_filter) as mayfail T
type node_filter is matching(N:node as boolean)
....

==== Move

A _((move))_ is a kind of destructive transfer which gives a value to
a new location, and link:#destruction[destroys] the original value.
The intent is that a move is generally cheaper to perform than a copy.
XL uses the prefix `move` function or the infix `Target :< Source` as
a notation for the move, where the `:<` is designed to look like a
scissor and is pronounced as _((cuts))_.

The performance benefit of using a move rather than a copy can be
significant. For example, even for a complex, deep data structure, a
move may involve simply copying a pointer to some new location and
making sure that the original pointer is no longer used, whereas a
copy may require a number of memory allocations and memory copies.
The downside, obviously, is that the source of the move may no longer
be used after the move.

The move operation has the following mandatory interface for all types:

....
Target:out T :< Source:in_out T as mayfail T
move Source:T as mayfail T is result :< Source
....

The move returns the `Target` after it has been moved into, or an
`error` value if there was some failure. When there is a failure,
the move should essentially have had no effect, i.e. it should not
cause partially moved, partially created or partially destroyed values.

The new moved value is link:#creation[created] by the operator, and
should be identical in its behavior to the source. Like for copy, it
needs not be identical in its internal representation. For example, if
you move a value with internal pointers, it may need to adjust the
pointers. Such cases should be infrequent, and are undesirable since
the main reason for `move` to exist is performance.

The source of a move may no longer be used after a move operation, and
should be in the same state as right after a `delete` operation. The
compiler should normally issue a diagnostic when an attempt is made to
use a value that was moved or deleted.

==== Binding

The transfer of an argument to a formal parameter during a call is
called a _((binding))_, and like an assignment, it may involve either
copying or moving the value. Argument binding uses the assignment
operator to assign the argument to the formal paramerer, ensuring that
the same copy or move semantics applies to assignment and to binding.

However, the precise transfer operations associated to binding
may be modified depending on the direction of the transfer between the
caller and the callee. The following type modifiers are provided to
indicate this direction and optimize argument passing accordingly:

* `in T` indicates that the corresponding value is passed from the
  caller to the callee. An `in T` value is read-only in the callee,
  since it is possible that it may be passed by reference. In other
  words, `in T` derives from `constant T`. A parameter with the `in`
  type modifier is called an _((input parameter))_ and the
  corresponding argument is called an _((input argument))_. The
  link:#lifetime[lifetime] of an input argument must be larger than
  that of the call, and ownership remains in the caller.

* `out T` indicates that the corresponding value is passed from the
  callee to the caller. In that case, the value is created in the
  callee, and moved to the caller on exit, destroying the previous
  value that may have existed for that argument in the caller.
  An `out T` inherits from `T`. A parameter with the `out` type
  modifier is called an _((output parameter))_ and the corresponding
  argument is called an _((output argument))_.

* `inout T`, which can also be spelled `in_out T`, `in out T` or `io T`,
  indicates that the corresponding value is tranferred to the callee
  for the duration of the call, and then transferred back to the caller.
  Its lifetime is interrupted in the caller for the duration of the call,
  and ownership is temporarily transferred to the callee.  The `inout
  T` type also inherits from `T`. A parameter with the `inout`
  modifier is called a _((bidirectional parameter))_ and the
  corresponding argument is called a _((bidirectional argument))_.

All these types are intended to provide access to a value of type `T`
within the caller in a way that is possibly less expensive than
directly using the assignment for `T`. Common optimization strategies
include:

* Passing a pointer to large values rather than copying them, a
  technique often called passing the value _((by reference))_.

* Copying or moving the value only in the required direction.

* Passing a smart reference that precisely tracks ownership.

An interesting example that illustrates the use of these type
modifiers is the `text` type. This is an example of owning type, since
it owns the `character` values in it. Since there is a possibly large
number of characters, it may be quite expensive to copy.

It would be inconveient to have pure move semantics for `text`, since
it would mean that an assignment would destroy the source value.
Consider the following code to see how this would be uncomfortable:

....
window_name  : text := "Untitled"
if file_name <> "" then
    window_name := file_name
path_is_absolute : boolean := file_name.begins_with("/")
....

Under a pure move semantics, in the above code, the second use of
`file_name` to compute `path_is_absolute` would be incorrect, since
the value in `file_name` might have been moved to `window_name` in
just the previous line. That would make using `text` quite complicated.
Indeed, Rust developers have to pay attention to this kind of
considerations with many types such as `vector`.

Instead, assignment for `text`, and therefore passing `text` values as
an argument, performs a copy of the `text` value. The binding
modifiers for `text`, however, use not `text` but `slice of text`, an
link:#access-types[access type] that is cheap to copy around, and that
references the original text. This organization provides the
convenience of copy semantics for local variables and the speed of
move semantics for calls.

==== Name parameters

In some cases, it is interesting for a form to create new variables
based on a name given as an argument. The corresponding parameter is
called a _((name parameter))_. An archetypcal example for this
is the `for` loop.

Consider the following simple example:

....
for I in 1..5 loop
    print "I=", I
....

The variable `I` in this example does not exist outside of the `for`
loop. This is accomplished by taking a `name` as a parameter.
The link:#metabox[metabox] notation can then be used to refer to the
actual name.

For example, a `for` loop on a range of discrete values can be written
as follows:

....
for N:name in R:[range of discrete] loop Body is <1>
    loop_context is <2>
        [[N]] : R.type := R.first <3>
    LoopVar is loop_context.[[N]] <4>
    while LoopVar <= R.last loop
        (loop_context) (Body) <5>
        ++LoopVar <6>
....
<1> `N` is declared as a `name`. This type is defined in `XL.PARSER`.
    The programmer can control what kind of input is acceptable to a
    new programming construct like the `for` loop defined here. The
    fact that the XL type system is based on the shape of parse trees
    gives a powerful way to achieve that objective.
<2> We need to create a `loop_context` scope that holds the variable
    created from the input argument to make sure that it does not pollute
   the current context of the function. For example, if the argument for
   `N` was `R`, we would not want to hide the `R` formal parameter with a
   local definition that has the same name.
<3> The link:#metabox[metabox] evaluates `N`, which gives us access to
    the name referenced by `N`. In the declaration, simply writing `N`
    would create a local variable named `N`.
<4> The `LoopVar` declaration is a shortcut to facilitate access to
    `[[N]]` within `loop_context`. The reference to `N` also needs to
    go through a metabox in order to lookup what `N` contains, and not
    the variable `N` within `loop_context`, does not exist except in
    cases where parameter `N` receives name `N` as an argument.
<5> The parentheses are not strictly necessary, but a good reminder
    that what we are doing here is evaluate `Body` after
    link:#scoping[injecting] the `loop_context` context. This is what
    makes the variable name referenced by `[[N]]` visible in
    `Body`. This approach lets the programmer precisely control what
    is being injected while evaluating `Body`. In particular, all the
    local variables in the implementation of the `for` loop, like `N`,
    `R`, `Body`, `LoopVar` or `loop_context` are not visible while
    evaluating `Body`.
<6> The `++LoopVar` notation is a generic way to increment any
    `discrete` value. In that case, `LoopVar += 1` would not work if
    `R` was for example a `range of character` like `'A'..'Z'`.


==== Attributes

Attributes are a types that behave like a value of a given type, but
with controlled access when reading or writing values. Attributes also
offer the convention that they can be written to by using them as a
prefix.

For example, a `background` feature with the `color` type can be
implemented as an attribute, which can then be used in any of the
following ways:

....
background : attribute[color]
if background = blue then
    background := red           // Assigment style
if background = green then
    background blue             // Attribute style
....

[NOTE]
=====
It is considered bad taste in XL to use explicitly getters or setters
as is common usage in languages such as Java. For example, the
following code is a very poor alternative to attributes:
....
get_background as color
set_background C:color as color
if get_background = blue then
   set_background red
....
=====

== Programming paradigms

The XL language features make it quite easy to follow and even enforce
the rules necessary to apply various common and less common
_((programming paradigm))s_.

In the following sections, we will consider the following major paradigms:

* <<Object-oriented programming>>
* <<Functional programming>>
* <<Generic programming>>
* <<Design by contract>>
* <<Distributed programming>>

We will also take a look at a few less common, if highly esteemed,
programming paradigms, which all carved a niche through
somewhat special-purpose programming languages:

* <<Aspect-oriented programming>>
* <<Logic programming>>
* <<Declarative programming>>
* <<Reactive programming>>
* <<Synchronous programming>>

The fact that XL seamlessly supports so many different programming
paradigms _together_ is a testimony to the extensible nature of the
language.(((extensible,language)))

=== Object-oriented programming

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming[Object-oriented programming]
is a programming paradigm based on the concept of _((object))s_,
which are self-contained units acting as black boxes, providing a
controlled interface to their internal _((data))_ through
_((method))s_. This provides a form of _((information hiding))_ that
helps with the long-term maintenance of the software by enforcing
rules about how to access the object.
Object-oriented programming relies on a number of features such as
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)[_((encapsulation))_]
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch[_((dynamic dispatch))_],
(sometimes called _((message passing))_),
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)[_((inheritance))_],
and link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)[_((polymorphism))_].

A common way to introduce object-oriented programming is with a
program that deals with various shapes. This is a good way to
illustrate the use of the fundamental object-oriented techniques. In
the following example, we will write such a program, which will both
illustrate the similarities of XL with a language like C++, as well as
the differences and how they can matter even on such a simple example.

==== Type interface

The first part of the program is to define the interface for the type
`shape`, which will act as the
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)[_((base class))_]
of our class hierarchy, and for the derived types that we will use in
our code. We will assume that we have an existing `coordinate` type
for shape coordinates, `dimension` for shape dimensions, and `color` for
shape colors.

A first attempt at building a type interface for `shape` and a couple
of derived types using the syntax for types we already saw would be:

....
// Base class
type shape with
    draw         as mayfail                     // Draw the shape
    fill_color   as attribute color             // Color of the fill
    stroke_color as attribute color             // Color of the stroke
    stroke_width as attribute dimension         // Width of the stroke
    top          as attribute coordinate        // Top coordinate
    left         as attribute coordinate        // Left coordinate
    bottom       as attribute coordinate        // Bottom coordinate
    right        as attribute coordinate        // Right coordinate
    x            as attribute coordinate        // Center horizontal coordinate
    y            as attribute coordinate        // Center vertical coordinate
    width        as attribute dimension         // Width of the shape
    height       as attribute dimension         // Height of the shape

// A few derived classes
rectangle as some shape

square as some rectangle with
    side        as attribute dimension

ellipse as some shape

circle as some shape with
    radius      as attribute dimension
    diameter    as attribute dimension
....

This style of code is called a _((type interface))_. It already shows
interesting properties that XL brings to the table. From the
interface, we see that we have multiple ways to access the same data,
namely the dimensions and position of the shape, which are obviously
related. The width of the shape is related to the left and right
coordinates, for example. However, the interface does not tell us how
the implementation choses to store the data. This provides stronger
information hiding than languages like {cpp}, where some
"private" data fields for the class would probably be exposed.

This means that client code can access all these features in a very
consistent and flexible manner, without bothering about how the data
is stored internally:

....
S : shape
S.top := 42                     // Assignment form
S.bottom 640                    // Attribute setting form
if S.height <> 598 then         // Reading the value
    logic_error "Somethign is wrong with your implementation, height is %1", S.height
....

As part of information hiding, the interface also purposefully does
not expose how `draw` is actually implemented. The `draw` method,
obviously, needs a different implementation for a `rectangle` and a
`circle`, but the interface does not expose that information, only the
fact that there is a `draw` method in `shape` and all derived types.

==== Class interface

However, our first interface remains somewhat verbose and cumbersome to
write. In order to support object-oriented programming better, there
is a `class` declaration helper that will generate the above code based on the
following input, transforming all fields into attributes and keeping
methods as is. This coding style is called a _((class interface))_:

....
class shape with
    draw        as mayfail
    fill_color   : color
    stroke_color : color
    stroke_width : dimension
    top          : coordinate
    left         : coordinate
    bottom       : coordinate
    right        : coordinate
    x            : coordinate
    y            : coordinate
    width        : dimension
    height       : dimension

class rectangle like shape

class square like rectangle with
    side         : dimension

class ellipse like shape

class circle like shape with
    radius       : dimension
    diameter     : dimension
....

==== Class implementation

In XL, the implementation of a type can be
link:#direct-implementation[directly related] to the interface, but
every field may also be implemented
link:#indirect-implementation[indirectly] using
link:#attributes[attributes].

For the shape class, let's make the choice that we will store the
center of the shape, its width and its height, and compute the
rest. We need a convention on what happens when we set `top`, for
example. A convention will be that it moves the whole shape without
changing its size, but we could also decide to not move the bottom for
example. We will also assume that `y` increases towards the top.
This particular choice leads to a class implementation that looks like:

....
class shape is
    draw is logic_error "Drawing a base shape"
    fill_color   : color
    stroke_color : color
    stroke_width : dimension
    x            : coordinate
    y            : coordinate
    width        : dimension
    height       : dimension

    left as attribute coordinate is
        get     is x - width / 2
        set L   is x += L - left
    right as attribute coordinate is
        get     is x + width / 2
        set R   is x += R - right
    top as attribute coordinate is
        get     is y + height / 2
        set T   is y += T - top
    bottom as attribute coordinate is
        get     is y - height / 2
        set B   is y += B - bottom
....

This kind implementations demonstrates how much freedom there is in
implementing a class interface.

==== Direct derivation

A derived class like `rectangle` can leverage the base class using
link:#data-inheritance[data inheritance], and then add a `draw`
method. This kind of derivation is called _((direct derivation))_.

....
class rectangle is shape with
    draw is
        draw_polygon fill_color, stroke_color, stroke_width,
            move_to top, left
            line_to top, right
            line_to bottom, right
            line_to bottom, left
            line_to top, left
....

Since the purpose of this document is not to focus on shape drawing
algorithms, but on object-oriented programming, we simply assumed that
there is some general `draw_polygon` utility that we can use.

Unlike languages like {cpp}, XL does not require the
interface of a derived class like `rectangle` to indicate that it will
override the `draw` feature from the base class.


==== Indirect derivation

Implementing the `square` type allows us to demonstrate an interesting
possibility of XL that does not exist in C++, which is to make a
derived class that does not inherit its data members from its base
class. A square does not need a separate width and height, so we could
make the data storage requirements for a `square` smaller by only
having it store a single `side` data value. The implementation of `square` can
however still inherit a lot of the implementation from `rectangle`,
but needs to rewrite `width` and `height` as attributes related to `side`:

....
class square is
    draw is rectangle.draw
    fill_color   : color
    stroke_color : color
    stroke_width : dimension
    x            : coordinate
    y            : coordinate
    side         : dimension

    width as attribute dimension is
        get     is side
        set W   is side := W
    height as attribute dimension is
        get     is side
        set H   is side := H

    left        is rectangle.left
    right       is rectangle.right
    top         is rectangle.top
    bottom      is rectangle.left
....

Obviously, the savings in the case of something as simple as a
`square` are quite limited. There are cases where this approach may
lead to much more significant improvements.

More importantly, this approach makes it possible to enforce stricter
rules for the derived types. In particular, this implementation of
`square` makes it absolutely impossible to end up with a `square` that
has a different value for `width` and `height`, even by mistake.

This is not a purely theoretical concern. In {cpp}, if the base
`Rectangle` class has different fields for `width` and `height`, the
derived `Square` class might initially enforce the rules, and be later
broken for example when the base `Shape` class adds a `scale` method
that scales width and height differently. Unless the `Square` class
itself is modified to implement its own version of `scale`, it will be
broken by a change in the base class. This category of issue is known
as the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_base_class[fragile base class]
problem.

We can also take advantage of this feature to have a different
hierarchy for data inheritance than for the interface. For example, we
can implement the `ellipse` and `circle` classes as follows:

....
class ellipse is rectangle with
    draw is
        draw_ellipse fill_color, stroke_color, stroke_width, x, y, width, height

class circle is square with
    draw is ellipse.draw
....

This flexibility gives the maximum potential for code reuse.

==== Dynamic dispatch

If we want to add a `group` shape, we need to be able to draw each
shape individually, according to its class.

....
class group like shape with
    children : string of shape
....

There is a problem with this interface, however. Each time you add a
`shape` to `children`, you really add a value that has the `shape`
type, not the `rectangle` or `circle` type. In order to preserve the
original type information, we need to use the `any shape` notation.
The correct class interface for `group` is:

....
class group like shape with
    children : string of any shape
....

The implementation can then invoke `draw` for each shape in
`children`, and since `any shape` retains the type of the associated
shape, this will call the appropriate `draw` feature for each of the
individual shapes. This technique is called _((dynamic dispatch))_.

The implementation of class `group` does not need the `shape` fields,
since it can compute features from the shapes in `children`. The
example below only shows the case of `draw`, `fill_color`, `top` and
`width`, but other features can be implemented in a similar way. The
`fill_color` attribute uses a local variable to hold the color value
for the whole group. These three examples show the respective benefits
of the various ways to set an attribute.

....
class group is
    // Draw a group by drawing all shapes in it
    draw is
        for S in children loop
            S.draw

    // The fill color is the last one set for the group
    fill_color as attribute color is
        value : color := black
        get   is value
        set C is
            value := C
            for S in children loop
                S.fill_color C

    // The top is the maximum of the top of all shapes
    top as attribute coordinate is
        get is
            result := coordinate.min
            for S in children loop
                if result < S.top then
                   result := S.top
        set T is
            delta is T - top
            for S in children loop
                S.top += delta

    // The width is still right - left, and adjusted by scaling
    width as attribute coordinate is
        get   is right - left
        set W is
            old is width
            for S in children loop
                S.width := S.width * W / old
....

In this code, all references to `S` have the type `any shape`, and
therefore, `S.width` or `S.draw` will be dynamically dispatched. This
plays the role to _((virtual functions))_ in {cpp}.

==== Multiple dispatch

An operation like `draw` really depends on a single `shape` value.
Many operations, however, require more than one value to operate. A
simple example would be an operation to intersect two shapes, which we
could write as `S1 and S2`, or merge two shapes, which we could write
as `A or B`. There are various special cases, followed by a more
general case:

....
A:rectangle and B:rectangle as rectangle
A:ellipse   and B:ellipse   as ellipse or path
A:rectangle and B:ellipse   as rectangle or ellipse or path
A:ellipse   and B:rectangle as rectangle or ellipse or path
A:group     and B:group     as group
A:any shape and B:any shape as any shape
....

The implementation for groups, for example, could look someting like
the following code, which intersects all pairs of shapes and adds the
result when it is not empty:

....
A:group and B:group as group is
    for SA in A.children loop
        for SB in B.children loop
            child is SA and SB
            if child.width > 0 and child.height > 0 then
                result.children &= child
....

The operation that computes `child` in the code above is `SA and
SB`. Since both `SA` and `SB` are dynamically typed, that operation
must perform a dynamic dispatch on both `SA` and `SB`. A feature like
tihs is sometimes called _((multiple dispatch))_ or
_((multi-methods))_ in link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch[other languages].
For example, if both shapes have the `rectangle` type, then the first
declaration would be called; if both shapes have the `ellipse` type,
then the second one would be invoked; and so on.

With code like this, it is possible to write a function that performs
clipping within a rectangle, where dynamic dispatch will occur only
for the second argument, and where the returned value will itself be
dynamically typed:

....
clip(Bounds:rectangle, Shape:any shape) as any shape is
    result := Bounds and Shape
....

== Compiling XL

The XL language is quite different from a language like C. Some of the
language constructs described in this document may seem a little bit
mysterious to programmers coming from such languages. This section
will explain how some of the features described previously can be
implemented, by showing examples using C code.

In the C code, the notation `{backtick}expr{backtick}` will denote a magical macro
creating a unique name attributed to the XL expression `expr`, and
`...` will indicate that what is presented is only a partial
representation, with the expectation that whas surrounds `...` allows
the reader to infer what can be there.

In addition, the example code will borrow two features from {cpp},
inheritance and overloading, so that we may write something like the
following in the examples:

....
struct Derived : Base { ... };
void foo(int);
void foo(double);
....

=== Normal representation

All XL source code and data can be represented using a homoiconic
representation that looks something like the following code, where `P`
is a shortcut for `XL.PARSER`.

First, there is a tag that can be used at run-time to discriminate
between the possible values, and a struct that holds the common
fields, notably a `position` field that can be used to identify a
precise source code position while printing error messages:

....
enum kind { NATURAL, REAL, CHARACTER, ... };
struct `P.tree`                       { enum kind kind; position_t position; ... };
....

The leaf nodes simpy contain one of the basic values tpyes that can be
foudn in the source code:

....
struct `P.natural`    : `P.tree`    { `natural` value; };
struct `P.real`       : `P.tree`    { `real` value; }
struct `P.character`  : `P.tree`    { `character` value; };
struct `P.text`       : `P.tree`    { `text` value; }
struct `P.bits`       : `P.tree`    { size_t size; void *data; }
struct `P.symbol`     : `P.tree`    { `text` value; }
struct `P.name`       : `P.symbol`  { };
struct `P.operator`   : `P.symbol`  { };
....

The inner nodes contain pointers to other nodes. These pointers are
never `NULL`, and the structure is a tree that is easily allocated or
deallocated. The previous XL implementations have pools for each type,
allowing faster fixed-size allocation without memory fragmentation.

....
struct `P.prefix`     : `P.tree`    { `P.tree` *left, *right; };
struct `P.postfix`    : `P.tree`    { `P.tree` *left, *right; };
struct `P.infix`      : `P.tree`    { `P.tree` *left, *right; `text` name; }
struct `P.block`      : `P.tree`    { `P.tree` *child; `text` opening, closing; }
....

This representation is called the _((normal representation))_ or
_((normal form))_ of the parse tree, and it corresponds almost
directly to the XL declarations link:#parser[given in module]
`XL.PARSER`. This is in particular the input to the `XL.TRANSLATOR`
module, and it can be evaluated directly.

=== Machine representation

The normal form is not very efficient, and generated machine code will
normally only use a _((machine representation))_ or  _((machine form))_
for both data and code.

When this is useful for proper evaluation, a normal form can be
_boxed_(((boxing))) into its equivalent machine representation, and
conversely, that machine representation can be
_unboxed_(((unboxing))). This process is called _((autoboxing))_, and
should be entirely transparent to the developer.

The machine representation for data is normally a `struct` that
contains the definitions in the
link:#pattern-matching-scope[pattern matching scope] for the type
being considered. For example:

....
// type complex is matching complex(Re:real, Im:real)
typedef struct `complex` { `real` Re; `real` Im; } complex_t;

// Z : complex := complex(1.2, 3.4)
complex_t Z = { 1.2, 3.4 };

// Z1:complex + Z2.complex is complex(Z1.Re+Z2.Re, Z1.Im+Z2.Im)
#define complex_add  `Z1:complex + Z2.complex`
complex_t complex_add(complex_t Z1, complex_t Z2)
{
    complex_t result;
    result.Re = Z1.Re + Z2.Re;
    result.Im = Z1.Im + Z2.Im;
    return result;
}
....

In the special case of types that contain only a single value, that
machine type itsef is used, since the XL compiler takes care of the
type checking aspects. In other words, there is no additional cost in
using this kind of type.

....
// type distance is matching distance(meters:real)
typedef `real` distance_t;    // Probably a double

// D1:distance + D2:distance is distance(D1.meters + D2.meters)
#define distance_add `D1:distance + D2:distance`
inline distance_t distance_add(distance_t D1, distance_t D2)
{
    return D1 + D2;
}
....

At lower levels of optimization, as was the case in Tao3D, the machine
representation for types with open-ended or unconstrained values will
typically contain the normal form, knowing that the passed normal form
will generally be the normal form for link:#closures[closures]:

....
// type if_statement is matching { if Condition then TrueClause else FalseClause }
struct `if_statement`
{
    `P.tree` *Condition;
    `P.tree` *TrueClause;
    `P.tree` *FalseClause;
};
....

=== Closures representation

Executable code and closures also have machine forms.
The machine form for a closure may look something like:

....
typedef `type of expression` expression_type;
struct `expression`
{
    expression_type (*code) (struct `expression` *closure, args...);
    `P.tree` *self; // If needed
    ... // additional data fields for captured data used by 'code'
};
....

For example, consider the `adder` example link:#cosures[given as an
example] for closures earlier, assuming we know that `N` and `X` are
`integer` values.

A first structure represents a function that takes a single `X`
argument, again assuming that argument is an `int`:

....
// adder N is { lambda X is X + N }
typedef struct `lambda X`
{
    int (*code) (struct `lambda X` *closure, int X);
} lambda;
....

However, if the code uses a variable like `N`, that variable is said
to be _captured_(((captured variable))). In order to be able to
preserve the value of that variable outside of the scope that created
it, another structure inheriting from `lambda` is needed:

....
typedef struct `lambda X capturing N` : lambda
{
    int N;
} lambda_N;
....

Using this data structure, it is now possible to generate the code for
the body of the anonymous function:

....
#define anonymous_function `X + N`
int anonymous_function(lambda_N *closure, int X)
{
    return X + closure->N;
}
....

That body can then be used to generate the code for the `adder`
function itself:

....
#define adder_name      `adder N`
lambda_N adder_name(int N)
{
    lambda_N result;
    result.code = anonymous_function;
    result.N = N;
    return result;
}
....

That code can be used to create values that represent the adder, along
with the data that it needs:

....
// add3 is adder 3
#define add3    `add3`
lambda_N add3 = adder_name(3)
....

Invoking that code is straightfordward:

....
// add3 5
add3.code(&add3, 5);
....

=== Type representation

The `type` type is a standard data type, which exposes a number of
features used by the XL runtime to manipulate values of the type:

....
struct `type`
{
    size_t (*size)    (void *value);    // Compute size of a value
    void   (*create)  (void *value);    // Create value of the type
    void   (*delete)  (void *value);    // Delete value of the type
    bool   (*contains)(void *value);    // Check if a value belong
    ...
};
....

When a type interface is provided, the actual type implementation may
be implemented as a structure that derives from `struct `type``.

....
// type shape_t with
//    draw         as mayfail
//    width        : coordinate

struct `shape_t`_interface : `type`
{
    `mayfail`           (*`draw`) (struct `shape` *shape);
    `coordinate`        (*`width`)(struct `shape` *shape);
    `coordinate`        (*`width`)(struct `shape` *shape, `coordinate` width);
}
....

The type interface can then be used by generated code in a way that is
largely independant of the actual layout for the object. The type
interface therefore gives a standard way to refer to the features of
the type. Since all the features are represented by pointer, derived
types may populate them by alternate values. This mechanism is overall
very similar to so-called _vtables_ in {cpp}, except that
interface calls for getters and setters are automatically generated.

For a direct implementation, wrappers to access the fields are
generated automatically, which can be removed by global optimization
if the implementation is known to be in the same load module as the
code using it:

....
// type shape_t is matching shape
//    draw is logic_error "Drawing a base shape"
//    width : coordinate
struct `shape`
{
    `coordinate` width;
};

static `mayfail` `draw`(`shape` *shape)
{
     `mayfail` result;
     result.kind = `error`
     result.error = `logic_error`("Drawing a base shape");
     return result;
}

static `coordinate` `width`_get(struct `shape` *shape)
{
    return shape->width;
}

static `coordinate` `width`_set(struct `shape` *shape, `coordinate` width)
{
    return shape->width = width;
}
....

It also needs to define the standard functions for a type:

....
static size_t size(`shape` *value)
{
    return sizeof(shape);
}

static void create(`shape` *shape)
{
    shape->width = 0;
}

static void delete(`shape` *shape)
{
}

static bool contains(`shape` *shape)
{
    return true; // No conditions on 'width'
}
....

With all these, the actual value for the type implementation can be
built simply by populating its various fields:

....
`shape_t`_interface `shape_t` =
{
    size,
    create,
    delete,
    contains,
    `draw`,
    `width`_get,
    `width`_set
}
....

All the code that views the implementation of `shape` can directly
access it:

....
// S.width := 387
S.width = 387;
....

This extends to code that is known by the compiler to be in the same
load module. In other words, the compiler is allowed to do global
optimizations across multiple files. If the actual type implementation
is not known, in particular because it resides in a different load
module (e.g. a shared library) that may change at runtime, then the
type structure is used instead:

....
// S.width := 387
`shape_t`.`width`_set(&S, 387);
....

Obviously, if we have an `attribute` instead, the `get` and `set`
functions are replaced with code generated from the attribute's `get`
and `set`, and the fields in the attribute are inserted in the type in
place of the attribute:

....
// type shape_t is matching shape
//    width as attribute coordinate is
//        attribute_width : some_other_integer
//        get   is attribute_width / 2
//        set W is attribute_width := W * 2
struct `shape`
{
    `some_other_integer` attribute_width;
};

static `coordinate` `width`_get(struct `shape` *shape)
{
    return shape->attribute_width / 2
}

static `coordinate` `width`_set(struct `shape` *shape, `coordinate` W)
{
    return shape->attribute_width = W * 2;
}
....

=== Discriminated types

For a type expression like `A or B`, a memory space can be occupied
by either a `A` or a `B`. In that case, the compiler needs to add a
field that helps identify which type is being represented. Such a
field is called a _discriminant_.

When there is a limited number of possible types, then the compiler
should generate an enumeration, since this makes it relatively easy to
crate dispatch tables. For example:

....
// my_type is integer or real
// triple X:my_type as my_type is X + X + X
struct `my_type`
{
    enum { `integer`_case, `real`_case } kind;
    union
    {
        `integer` a;
        `real` b;
    }
};

static `my_type` `triple`_a(`my_type` X)
{
    `my_type` result = { `integer`_case, a: X.a + X.a + X.a }
    return result;
}

static `my_type` `triple`_b(`my_type` X)
{
    `my_type` result = { `real`_case, b: X.b + X.b + X.b }
    return result;
}

`my_type` `triple`(`my_type` X)
{
    typedef `my_type`(*impl)(`my_type` X);
    static impl impls[] = { `triple`_a, `triple`_b };
    return impls[X.kind](X);
}
....

The `any T` type can accept a much larger and open-ended set of
types. In that case, the discriminant must be a type.

....
// S : any shape_t
struct `any shape_t`
{
    struct `shape_t`_interface *type;
    struct `shape_t` *value;
} S;

// S := rectangle(1,2,3,4)
`rectangle` tmp_r = { 1, 2, 3, 4};
S.type = `rectangle`;
S.value = &tmp_r;

// S := circle(0, 0, 100)
`circle` tmp_c = { 0, 0, 100 };
S.type =`circle`;
S.value = &tmp_c;
....

=== Compiling variable-sized types

The `size` field in types takes a value of the type. This is intended
to allow the implementation to work with
link:#variable-sized-types[variable-sized types].

For example, the `size` for `packet` type can be implemented by adding
the size of the `header` and `payload` parts, the payload itself
having a variable size.

....
// type header is matching header (byte_count:size)
typedef size_t `header`;
size_t `size` (`header` *value) { return sizeof(`header`); }

// payload[byte_count:size] is array[byte_count] of byte
typedef
{
     size_t byte_count;
     struct `array` array;
} `payload`;

size_t `size`(`payload` *value)
{
    return sizeof(value->byte_count)
         + `array`.size(&value->array)
         + value->byte_count * sizeof(byte);
}
....

This also means that all access to individual features may need
several steps of computation.

=== Constrained types


=== Dynamic dispatch


== Basic operations

== [[module]]Modules

== Standard Library

The ((standard library)) provides the vast majority of the features
available to the XL developer.

=== Garbage collection

== History of XL

The status of the current XL compiler is link:{xl}#compiler-status[a bit
messy]. There is a rationale to this madness. I attempt to give it here.

There is also a
https://grenouillebouillie.wordpress.com/2017/12/10/from-ada-to-xl-in-25-years/[blog
version] if you prefer reading on the web (but it’s not exactly
identical). In both cases, the article is a bit long, but it’s worth
understanding how XL evolved, and why the XL compiler is still work in
progress.

=== It started as an experimental language

Initially, XL was called LX, "Langage experimental" in French, or as
you guessed it, an experimental language. Well, the very first codename
for it was "WASHB" (What Ada Should Have Been). But that did not sound
very nice. I started working on it in the early 1990s, after a training
period working on the Alsys Ada compiler.

What did I dislike about Ada? I never liked magic in a language. To me,
keywords demonstrate a weakness in the language, since they indicated
something that you could not build in the library using the language
itself. Ada had plenty of keywords and magic constructs. Modern XL has
no keyword whatsoever, and it’s a Good Thing (TM).

Let me elaborate a bit on some specific frustrations with Ada:

* Tasks in Ada were built-in language constructs. This was inflexible.
Developers were already hitting limits of the Ada-83 tasking model. My
desire was to put any tasking facility in a library, while retaining an
Ada-style syntax and semantics.
* Similarly, arrays were defined by the language. I wanted to build them
(or, at least, describe their interface) using standard language
features such as generics. Remember that this was years before the STL
made it to {cpp}, but I was thinking along similar lines. Use cases I had
in mind included:
** interfacing with languages that had different array layouts such as
Fortran and C,
** using an array-style interface to access on-disk records. Back then,
`mmap` was unavailable on most platforms,
** smart pointers that would also work with on-disk data structures,
** text handling data structures (often called "strings") that did not
expose the underlying implementation (e.g. "pointer to char" or
"character array"), …
* Ada text I/O facilities were uncomfortable. But at that time, there
was no good choice. You had to pick your poison:
** In Pascal, `WriteLn` could take as many arguments as you needed and
was type safe, but it was a magic procedure, that you could not write
yourself using the standard language features, nor extend or modify to
suit your needs.
** Ada I/O functions only took one argument at a time, which made
writing the simplest I/O statement quite tedious relative to C or
Pascal.
** C’s `printf` statement had multiple arguments, but was neither type
safe nor extensible, and the formatting string was horrid.
* I also did not like Ada pragmas, which I found too ad-hoc, with a
verbose syntax. I saw pragmas as indicative that some kind of generic
"language extension" facility was needed, although it took me a while
to turn that idea into a reality.

I don’t have much left of that era, but that first compiler was
relatively classical, generating 68K assembly language. I reached the
point where the compiler could correctly compile a "Hello World" style
program using an I/O library written in the language. I was doing that
work at home on Atari-ST class machines, but also gave demos to my HP
colleagues running XL code on VME 68030 boards.

From memory, some of the objectives of the language at the time
included:

* Giving up on superfluous syntactic markers such as terminating
semi-colon.
* Using generics to write ((standard library)) component such as arrays or
I/O facilities.
* Making the compiler an integral part of the language, which led to…
* Having a normalised abstract syntax tree, and…
* Considering "pragmas" as a way to invoke compiler extensions.
Pragmas in XL were written using the `{pragma}` notation, which would
indirectly invoke some arbitrary code through a table.

Thus, via pragmas, the language became extensible. That led me to…

=== LX, an extensible language

I wanted to have a relatively simple way to extend the language. Hence,
circa 1992, the project was renamed from "experimental" to
"extensible", and it has kept that name since then.

One example of thing I wanted to be able to do was to put tasking in a
library in a way that would "feel" similar to Ada tasking, with the
declaration of task objects, rendez-vous points that looked like
procedures with parameter passing, and so on.

I figured that my `{annotations}` would be a neat way to do this, if
only I made the parse tree public, in the sense that it would become a
public API. The idea was that putting `{annotation}` before a piece of
code would cause the compiler to pass the parse tree to whatever
function was associated with `annotation` in a table of annotation
processors. That table, when pointing to procedures written in XL, would
make writing new language extensions really easy. Or so I thought.

Ultimately, I would make it work. If you are curious, you can see the
link:{xl}xl2/native/xl.semantics.instructions.xl#L629[grand-child of that
idea] in the `translation` statements under `xl2/`. But that was way
beyond what I had initially envisionned, and the approach in the first
XL compiler did not quite work. I will explain why soon below.

The first experiment I ran with this, which became a staple of XL since
then, was the `{derivation}` annotation. It should have been
`{differentiation}`, but at that time, my English was quite crappy, and
in French, the word for "differentiation" is "derivation". The idea
is that if you prefixed some code, like a function, with a
`{derivation}` annotation, the parse tree for that function would be
passed to the `derivation` pragma handler, and that would replace
expressions that looked like differential expressions with their
expanded value. For example, `{derivation} d(X+sin(X))/dX` would
generate code that looked like `1 + cos(X)`.

If you are curious what this may look like, there are still
link:{xl}xl2/native/TESTS/07.Plugins[tests in the XL2 test suite] using a
very similar feature and syntax.

=== LX, meet Xroma

That initial development period for LX lasted between 1990, the year of
my training period at Alsys, and 1998, when I jointed the HP California
Language Lab in Cupertino (CLL). I moved to the United States to work on
the HP {cpp} compiler and, I expected, my own programming language. That
nice plan did not happen exactly as planned, though…

One of the very first things I did after arriving in the US was to
translate the language name to English. So LX turned into XL. This was a
massive rename in my source code, but everything else remained the same.

As soon as I joined the CLL, I started talking about my language and the
ideas within. One CLL engineer who immediately "got it" is Daveed
Vandevoorde. Daveed immediately understood what I was doing, in large
part because he was thinkering along the same lines. He pointed out that
my approach had a name: meta-programming, i.e. programs that deal with
programs. I was doing meta-programming without knowing about the word,
and I felt really stupid at the time, convinced that everybody in the
compilers community knew about that technique but me.

Daveed was very excited about my work, because he was himself working on
his own pet language named Xroma (pronounced like Chroma). At the time,
Xroma was, I believe, not as far along as XL, since Daveed had not
really worked on a compiler. However, it had annotations similar to my
pragmas, and some kind of public representation for the abstract syntax
tree as well.

Also, the Xroma name was quite Xool, along with all the puns we could
build using a capital-X pronounced as "K" (Xolor, Xameleon, Xode, …)
or not (Xform, Xelerate, …) As a side note, I later called
"Xmogrification" the VM context switch in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Integrity_Virtual_Machines[HPVM],
probably in part as a residual effect of the Xroma naming conventions.

In any case, Daveed and I joined forces. The combined effort was named
Xroma. I came up with the early version of the lightbulb logo still
currently used for XL, using FrameMaker drawing tools, of all things.
Daveed later did a nice 3D rendering of the same using the Persistence
of Vision ray tracer. I don’t recall when the current logo was
redesigned.

=== XL moves to the off-side rule

Another major visual change that happened around that time was switching
to the off-side rule, i.e. using indentation to mark the syntax. Python,
which made this approach popular, was at the time a really young
language (release 1.0 was in early 1994).

Alain Miniussi, who made a brief stint at the CLL, convinced me to give
up the Ada-style `begin` and `end` keywords, using an solid
argumentation that was more or less along the lines of "I like your
language, but there’s no way I will use a language with `begin` and
`end` ever again". Those were the times where many had lived the
transition of Pascal to C, some still wondering how C won.

I was initially quite skeptical, and reluctantly tried an
indentation-based syntax on a fragment of the XL ((standard library)). As
soon as I tried it, however, the benefits immediately became apparent.
It was totally consistent with a core tenet of concept programming that
I was in the process of developing (see below), namely that the code
should look like your concepts. Enforcing indentation made sure that the
code did look like what it meant.

It took some effort to convert existing code, but I’ve never looked back
since then. Based on the time when Alain Miniussi was at the CLL, I
believe this happened around 1999.

=== Concept programming

The discussions around our respective languages, including the
meta-programming egg-face moment, led me to solidify the theoretical
underpinning of what I was doing with XL. My ideas actually did go quite
a bit beyond mere meta-programming, which was really only a technique
being used, but not the end goal. I called my approach _Concept
Programming_. I tried to explain what it is about in
http://xlr.sourceforge.net/Concept%20Programming%20Presentation.pdf[this
presentation]. Concept programming is the theoretical foundation for XL.

Concept programming deals with the way we transform concepts that reside
in our brain into code that resides in the computer. That conversion is
lossy, and concept programming explores various techniques to limit the
losses. It introduces pseudo-metrics inspired by signal processing such
as ((syntactic noise)), ((semantic noise)), ((bandwidth)) and
((signal/noise ratio)).
These tools, as simple as they were, powerfully demonstrated limitations
of existing languages and techniques.

Since then, Concept Programming has consistently guided what I am doing
with XL. Note that Concept Programming in the XL sense has little do do
with {cpp} concepts (although there may be a connection, see blog
referenced above for details).

=== Mozart and Moka: Adding Java support to XL

At the time, Java was all the rage, and dealing with multiple languages
within a compiler was seen as a good idea. GCC being renamed from "GNU
C Compiler" to the "GNU Compiler Collection" is an example of this
trend.

So with Daveed, we had started working on what we called a "universal
program database", which was basically a way to store and access
program data independently of the language being used. In other words,
we were trying to create an API that would make it possible to
manipulate programs in a portable way, whether the program was written
in C, {cpp} or Java. That proved somewhat complicated in practice.

Worse, Daveed Vandevoord left the HP CLL to join the Edison Design
Group, where he’s still working to this date. Xroma instantly lost quite
a bit of traction within the CLL. Also, Daveed wanted to keep the Xroma
name for his own experiments. So we agreed to rename "my" side of the
project as "Mozart". For various reasons, including a debate regarding
ownership of the XL code under California law, the project was
open-sourced. The http://mozart-dev.sourceforge.net[web site] still
exists to this day, but is not quite functional since CVS support was
de-commissioned from SourceForge.

Part of the work was to define a complete description of the source code
that could be used for different language. Like for Xroma, we stayed on
bad puns and convoluted ideas for naming. In Mozart that representation
was called `Coda`. It included individual source elements called `Notes`
and the serialized representation was called a `Tune`. Transformation on
Notes, i.e. the operations of compiler plug-ins, were done by
`Performer` instances. A couple of years later, I would realize that
this made the code totally obfuscated for the non-initiated, and I vowed
to never make that mistake again.

Mozart included http://mozart-dev.sourceforge.net/moka.html[Moka], a
Java to Java compiler using Mozart as its intermediate representation. I
published an http://www.drdobbs.com/jvm/what-is-moka/184404696[article
in Dr Dobb’s journal], a popular developers journal at the time.

But my heart was never with Java anymore than with {cpp}, as evidenced by
the much more extensive documentation about XL on the Mozart web site.
As a language, Java had very little interest for me. My management at HP
had no interest in supporting my pet language, and that was one of the
many reasons for me to leave the CLL to start working on virtualization
and initiate what would become HPVM.

=== Innovations in 2000-vintage XL

By that time, XL was already quite far away from the original Ada, even
if it was still a statically typed, ahead-of-time language. Here are
some of the key features that went quite a bit beyond Ada:

* The syntax was quite clean, with very few unnecessary characters.
There were no semi-colons at the end of statement, and parentheses were
not necessary in function or procedure calls, for example. The off-side
rule I talked about earlier allowed me to get rid of any `begin` or
`end` keyword, without resorting to C-style curly braces to delimit
blocks.
* Pragmas extended the language by invoking
http://mozart-dev.sourceforge.net/tools.html#pragma[arbitrary compiler
plug-ins]. I suspect that attributes in {cpp}11 are distant (and less
powerful) descendants of this kind of annotation, if only because their
syntax matches my recollection of the annotation syntax in Xroma, and
because Daveed has been a regular and innovative contributor to the {cpp}
standard for two decades…
* http://mozart-dev.sourceforge.net/xl_style.html#expred[Expression
reduction] was a generalisation of operator overloading that works with
expressions of any complexity, and could be used to name types. To this
day, expression reduction still has no real equivalent in any other
language that I know of, although expression templates can be used in
{cpp} to achieve similar effect in a very convoluted and less powerful
way. Expression templates will not allow you to add operators, for
example. In other words, you can redefine what `X+Y*Z` means, but you
cannot create `X in Y..Z` in {cpp}.
* http://mozart-dev.sourceforge.net/xl_style.html#truegen[True generic
types] were a way to make generic programming much easier by declaring
generic types that behaved like regular types. Validated generic types
extended the idea by adding a validation to the type, and they also have
no real equivalent in other languages that I am aware of, although {cpp}
concepts bring a similar kind of validation to {cpp} templates.
* http://mozart-dev.sourceforge.net/xl_style.html#vararg[Type-safe
variable argument lists] made it possible to write type-safe variadic
functions. They solved the `WriteLn` problem I referred to earlier,
i.e. they made it possible to write a function in a library that behaved
exactly like the Pascal `WriteLn`. I see them as a distant ancestor of
variadic templates in {cpp}11, although like for concepts, it is hard to
tell if variadic templates are a later reinvention of the idea, or if
something of my e-mails influenced members of the {cpp} committee.
* A powerful ((standard library)) was in the making. Not quite there yet,
but the key foundations were there, and I felt it was mostly a matter of
spending the time writing it.
link:{xl}xl2/native/library/xl.math.complex.xl[My implementation of
complex numbers], for example, was
http://mozart-dev.sourceforge.net/news.html#complex[70% faster than {cpp}
on] simple examples, because it allowed everything to be in registers
instead of memory. There were a few things that I believe also date from
that era, like getting rid of any trace of a main function, top-level
statements being executed as in most scripting languages.

=== XL0 and XL2: Reinventing the parse tree

One thing did not work well with Mozart, however, and it was the parse
tree representation. That representation, called `Notes`, was quite
complicated. It was some kind of object-oriented representation with
many classes. For example, there was a class for `IfThenElse`
statements, a `Declaration` class, and so on.

This was all very complicated and fragile, and made it extremely
difficult to write thin tools (i.e. compiler plug-ins acting on small
sections of code), in particular thin tools that respected subtle
semantic differences between languages. By 2003, I was really hitting a
wall with XL development, and that was mostly because I was also trying
to support the Java language which I did not like much.

One of the final nails in the Mozart coffin was a meeting with Alan Kay,
of Smalltalk fame, during an HP technical conference. Kay was an HP
Fellow at the time. I tried to show him how my language was solving some
of the issues he had talked about during his presentation. He did not
even bother looking. He simply asked: “_Does your language
self-compile?_“. When I answered that the compiler was written in {cpp},
Alan Kay replied that he was not interested.

That gave me a desire to consider a true bootstrap of XL. That meant
rewriting the compiler from scratch. But at that time, I had already
decided that the internal parse tree representation needed to be
changed. So that became my topic of interest.

The new implementation was called XL2, not just as a version number, but
because I was seeing things as a three-layer construction:

* `XL0` was just a very simple parse tree format with only eight node
  types. I sometimes refer to that level of XL as "__XML without the
  M__", i.e. an extensble language without markup.
* `XL1` was the core language evaluation rules, not taking any library
  into account.
* `XL2` was the full language, including its ((standard library)). At the
  time, the goal was to reconstruct a language that would be as close as
  possible at the version of XL written using the Mozart framework.

This language is still available today, and while it’s not been
maintained in quite a while, it seems to still pass most of its test
suite. More importantly, the `XL0` format has remained essentially
unchanged since then.

The XL0 parse tree format is something that I believe makes XL
absolutely unique among high-level programming languages. It is designed
so that code that can look and feel like an Ada derivative can be
represented and manipulated in a very simple way, much like Lisp lists
are used to represent all Lisp programs. XL0, however, is not some minor
addition on top of S-expressions, but rather the definition of an
alternative of S-expressions designed to match the way humans parse
code.

The parse tree format consists of only eight node types, four leaf node
types (integer, real, text and symbol), four inner node types (infix,
prefix, postfix and block).

* `Integer` represents integer numbers, like `123` or `16#FFFF_FFFF`. As
the latter example shows, the XL syntax includes support for based
numbers and digit grouping.
* `Real` represents floating-point numbers, like `123.456` or
`2#1.001_001#e-3`. Like for `Integer`, XL supports based floating-point
numbers and digit grouping.
* `Text` represents textual constants like `"Hello"` or `'A'`.
* `Name` represents names like `ABC` or symbols like `+<=+`.
* `Infix` represents operations where a name is between two operands,
like `A+B` or `A and B`.
* `Prefix` represents operations where an operator precedes its operand,
like `sin X` or `-4`.
* `Postfix` represents operations where an operator follows its operand,
like `3 km` or `5%`.
* `Block` represents operations where an operand is surrounded by two
names, like `[A]`, `(3)` or `{write}`.

Individual program lines are seen as the leaves of an infix "newline"
operator. There are no keywords at all, the precedence of all operators
being given dynamically by a syntax file.

=== Bootstrapping XL

The initial translator converts a simplified form of XL into {cpp} using a
very basic transcoding that involves practically no semantic analysis.
The limited XL2 acceptable as input for this translation phase is only
used in the bootstrap compiler. It already looks a bit like the final
XL2, but error checking and syntax analysis are practically nonexistent.

The bootstrap compiler can then be used to translate the native XL
compiler. The native compiler performs much more extended semantic
checks, for example to deal with generics or to implement a true module
system. It emits code using a configurable "byte-code" that is
converted to a variety of runtime languages. For example, the C bytecode
file will generate a C program, turning the native compiler into a
transcoder from XL to C.

That native compiler can translate itself, which leads to a true
bootstrap where the actual compiler is written in XL, even if a C
compiler is still used for the final machine code generation. Using a
Java or Ada runtime, it would theoretically be possible to use a Java or
Ada compiler for final code generation.

The XL2 compiler advanced to the point where it could pass a fairly
large number of complex tests, including practically all the things that
I wanted to address in Ada:

* Pragmas implemented as link:{xl}xl2/native/TESTS/07.Plugins[compiler
plug-ins].
* Expression reduction
link:{xl}xl2/native/TESTS/05.Expressions/multi-reduction.xl[generalising
operator overloading].
* An I/O library that was
link:xl2/native/TESTS/12.Library/hello_world.xl[as usable as in Pascal],
but link:{xl}xl2/native/library/xl.text_io.xl[written in the language]
and
link:{xl}xl2/native/TESTS/12.Library/instantiation_of_complex.xl#L8[user-extensible].
* A language powerful enough to define its own
link:{xl}xl2/native/library/xl.array.xs[arrays] or
link:{xl}xl2/native/library/xl.pointer.address.xs[pointers], while
keeping them exactly
link:{xl}xl2/native/TESTS/08.Aggregates/basic-array.xl[as usable as
built-in types].

=== XL2 compiler plugins

XL2 has link:{xl}xl2/native/TESTS/07.Plugins[full support for compiler
plug-ins], in a way similar to what had been done with Mozart. However,
plug-ins were much simpler to develop and maintain, since they had to
deal with a very simple parse tree structure.

For example, the
link:{xl}xl2/native/xl.plugin.differentiation.xl[differentiation plugin]
implements symbolic differentiation for common functions. It is tested
link:{xl}xl2/native/TESTS/07.Plugins/differentiation.xl#L33[here]. The
generated code after applying the plugin would
link:{xl}xl2/native/TESTS/07.Plugins/differentiation_cmd_line.ref[look
like this]. The plugin itself is quite simple. It simply applies basic
mathematical rules on parse trees. For example, to perform symbolic
differentiation on multiplications, the code looks like this:

[source]
----
function Differentiate (expr : PT.tree; dv : text) return PT.tree is
    translate expr
        when ('X' * 'Y') then
            dX : PT.tree := Differentiate(X, dv)
            dY : PT.tree := Differentiate(Y, dv)
            return parse_tree('dX' * 'Y' + 'X' * 'dY')
----

Meta-programming became almost entirely transparent here. The
`translate` statement, itself provided by a compiler plug-in (see
below), matches the input tree against a number of shapes. When the tree
looks like `X*Y`, the code behind the matching `then` is evaluated. That
code reconstructs a new parse tree using the `parse_tree` function.

Also notice the symmetric use of quotes in the `when` clause and in the
`parse_tree` function, in both cases to represent variables as opposed
to names in the parse tree. Writing `parse_tree(X)` generates a parse
tree with the name `X` in it, whereas `parse_tree('X')` generates a
parse tree from the `X` variable in the source code (which must be a
parse tree itself).

=== XL2 internal use of plugins: the `translation` extension

The compiler uses this plug-in mechanism quite extensively internally. A
particularly important compiler extension provides the `translation` and
`translate` instructions. Both were used extensively to rewrite XL0
parse trees easily.

We saw above an example of `translate`, which translated a specific tree
given as input. It simply acted as a way to compare a parse tree against
a number of forms, evaluating the code corresponding to the first match.

The `translation` declaration is even more interesting, in that it is a
non-local function declaration. All the `translation X` from all modules
are accumulated in a single `X` function. Functions corresponding to
`translation X` and `translation Y` will be used to represent distinct
phases in the compiler, and can be used a regular functions taking a
tree as input and returning the modified tree.

This approach made it possible to distribute `translation XLDeclaration`
statements link:{xl}xl2/native/xl.semantics.functions.xl#L371[throughout
the compiler], dealing with declaration of various entities, with
matching `translation XLSemantics` took care of
link:{xl}xl2/native/xl.semantics.functions.xl#L557[the later semantics
analysis phase].

Writing code this way made it quite easy to maintain the compiler over
time. It also showed how concept programming addressed what is sometimes
called
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming[aspect-oriented
programming]. This was yet another proof of the "extensible" nature of
the language.

=== Switching to dynamic code generation

One issue I had with the original XL2 approach is that it was strictly a
static compiler. The bytecode files made it possible to generate
practically any language as output. I considered generating LLVM
bitcode, but thought that it would be more interesting to use an XL0
input instead. One reason to do that was to be able to pass XL0 trees
around in memory without having to re-parse them. Hence XLR, the XL
runtime, was born. This happened around 2009.

For various reasons, I wanted XLR to be dynamic, and I wanted it to be
purely functional. My motivations were:

* a long-time interest in functional languages.
* a desire to check that the XL0 representation could also comfortably
represent a functional languages, as a proof of how general XL0 was.
* an intuition that sophisticated
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference[type inference],
Haskell-style, could make programs both shorter and more solid than the
declarative type systems of Ada.

While exploring functional languages, I came across
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_(programming_language)[Pure], and
that was the second big inspiration for XL. Pure prompted me to use LLVM
as a final code generator, and to keep XLR extremely simple.

=== Translating using only tree rewrites

I sometimes describe XLR as a language with a single operator, `is`,
which reads as _transforms into_. Thus, `X is 0` declares that `X` has
value `0`.

Until very recently, that operator was spelled using an arrow, as `->`,
which I thought expressed the _transforms into_ quite well. Around 2018,
I decided that this was unreadable for the novice, and switched to using
`is` as this _definition operator_. This `->` operator is still what you
will find for example on the http://tao3d.sourceforge.net[Tao3D web
site].

This notation can be used to declare basic operators:

[source]
----
x:integer - y:integer as integer    is opcode Sub
----

It makes a declaration of `writeln` even shorter than it was in XL2:

[source]
----
write x:text as boolean             is C xl_write_text
write x:integer as boolean          is C xl_write_integer
write x:real as boolean             is C xl_write_real
write x:character as boolean        is C xl_write_character
write A, B                          is write A; write B
writeln as boolean                  is C xl_write_cr
writeln X as boolean                is write X; writeln
----

CAUTION: The precedence of `;` was changed over time. It is now lower
than `is`, but was higher at the time to make it possible to write the
code above without curly braces. See the rationale in
link:#expression-vs-statemnt[expression vs. statement] for an
explanation of why this was changed.

More interestingly, even if-then-else can be described that way:

[source]
----
if true  then TrueBody else FalseBody   is TrueBody
if false then TrueBody else FalseBody   is FalseBody
if true  then TrueBody                  is TrueBody
if false then TrueBody                  is false
----

CAUTION: The above code now requires a link:#metabox[metabox] for `true` in
the version of XL described in this document, i.e. `true` must be
replaced with `+[[true]]+` in order to avoid being interpreted as a
formal parameter.

Similarly for basic loops, provided your translation mechanism
implements ((tail recursion)) properly:

[source]
----
while Condition loop Body is
    if Condition then
        Body
    while Condition loop Body

until Condition loop Body is while not Condition loop Body

loop Body is { Body; loop Body }

for Var in Low..High loop Body is
    Var := Low
    while Var < High loop
        Body
        Var := Var + 1
----

NOTE: The fact that such structures can be implemented in the library
does not mean that they have to. It is simply a proof that basic
amenities can be constructed that way, and to provide a reference
definition of the expected behaviour.

=== Tao3D, interactive 3D graphics with XL

When I decided to leave HP, I thought that XLR was flexible enough to be
used as a dynamic document language. I quickly whipped together a
prototype using XLR to drive an OpenGL 3D rendering engine. That proved
quite interesting.

Over time, that prototype morphed into http://tao3d.sf.net[Tao3D]. As
far as the XLR language itself is concerned, there wasn’t as much
evolution as previously. A few significant changes related to usability
popped up after actively using the language:

* Implicit conversions of integer to real were not in the original XLR,
but it was quite annoying in practice when providing object coordinates.
* The XL version in Tao3D also became sensitive to spacing around
operators, so as to distinguish `Write -A` from `X - Y`. Earlier
versions forced you to use parentheses in the first case, as in
`Write (-A)`, which was quite against the ideas of concept programming
that your code must match your ideas.
* The more important change was the integration in the language of
reactivity to transparently deal with events such as mouse, keyboard or
time. Thus, the Tao3D language a fully functional-reactive language,
without changing the core translation technology at all.

Precisely because the changes were so minor, Tao3D largely proved the
point that XL was really extensible. For example, a `slide` function
(that takes code as its second argument) makes it easy to describe a
great-looking bullet points slide:

[source]
----
import WhiteChristmasTheme
theme "WhiteChristmas"

slide "An example slide",
    * "Functional reactive programming is great"
    color_hsv mouse_x, 100%, 100%
    * "This text color changes with the mouse"
    color_hsv time * 20, 100%, 100%
    * "This text color changes with time"
----

and get an animated slide that looks like this:

image:images/tao3dtheme1.png[Tao3D slide]

The same technique goes well beyond mere bullet points:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wTQcKvhReo[image:images/tao3d-slide.jpg]

Tao3D developed a relatively large set of specialised modules, dealing
with things such as stereoscopy or lens flares. As a product, however,
it was never very successful, and Taodyne shut down in 2015, even if the
open-source version lives on.

Unfortunately, Tao3D was built on a relatively weak implementation of
XL, where the type system in particular was not well thought out (it was
really a hack that only supported parse tree types). This made a few
things really awkward. Notably, all values are passed by reference,
which was mostly an implementation hack to enable the user-interface to
"retrofit" values into the code when you move shapes on the screen.
Unfortunately, this made the language brittle, and forced many modules
to rely on poor hacks when updating values. To make a long story short,
`X := Y` in Tao3D is a joke, and I’m rightfully ashamed of it.

=== ELFE, distributed programming with XL

https://github.com/c3d/elfe[ELFE] was another experiment with XL, that
took advantage of XL’s extensibility to explore yet another application
domain, namely distributed software, with an eye on the Internet of
Things. The idea was to take advantage of the existence of the XL0
standard parse tree to communicate programs and data across machines.

An ELFE program looks as as if it was running on a single machine, but
actively exchanges program segments and their associated data between
distant nodes (in modern XL, `->` below would read `is`):

[source]
----
invoke "pi2.local",
   every 1.1s,
        rasp1_temp ->
            ask "pi.local",
                temperature
        send_temps rasp1_temp, temperature

   send_temps T1:real, T2:real ->
       if abs(T1-T2) > 2.0 then
           reply
               show_temps T1, T2

show_temps T1:real, T2:real ->
    write "Temperature on pi is ", T1, " and on pi2 ", T2, ". "
    if T1>T2 then
        writeln "Pi is hotter by ", T1-T2, " degrees"
    else
        writeln "Pi2 is hotter by ", T2-T1, " degrees"
----

ELFE only adds a very small number of features to the standard XL, which
are simply regular XL functions implemented in {cpp}:

* The `ask` statement sends a program, and returns the result of
  evaluating that program as if it has been evaluated locally. It works
  like a remote function call.
* An `invoke` statement sends a program to a remote node. It’s a "fire
  and forget" operation, but leaves a reply channel open while it’s
  executing.
* Finally, the `reply` statement allows a remote node to respond to
  whoever `invoke`‘d it, by evaluating one of the available functions in
  the caller’s context.

A few very simple link:{xl}demo[ELFE demos] illustrate these
remote-control capabilities. For example, it’s easy to
link:{xl}demo/7-two-hops.xl[monitor temperature] on two remote sensor
nodes, and to ask them to report if their temperatures differ by more
than some specified amount. The code is very short and looks like this:

[source]
----
invoke "pi2.local",
   every 1.1s,
        rasp1_temp ->
            ask "pi.local",
                temperature
        send_temps rasp1_temp, temperature

   send_temps T1:real, T2:real ->
       if abs(T1-T2) > 2.0 then
           reply
               show_temps T1, T2

show_temps T1:real, T2:real ->
    write "Temperature on pi is ", T1, " and on pi2 ", T2, ". "
    if T1>T2 then
        writeln "Pi is hotter by ", T1-T2, " degrees"
    else
        writeln "Pi2 is hotter by ", T2-T1, " degrees"
----

ELFE was designed to run with a small memory footprint, so it provides a
complete interpreter that does not require any LLVM. As the names in the
example above suggest, it was tested on Raspberry Pi. On the other hand,
the LLVM support in that "branch" of the XL family tree fell into a
bad state of disrepair.

=== XL gets a type system

Until that point, XL lacked a real type system. What was there was
mostly quick-and-dirty solutions for the most basic type checks. Over a
Christmas vacation, I spent quite a bit of time thinking about what a
good type system would be for XL. I was notably stumped by what the type
of `if-then-else` statements should be.

The illumination came when I realized that I was blocked in my thinking
by the false constraint that each value had to have a single type.
Instead, the type system that seems natural in XL is that a type
indicates the shape of a parse tree. For example, `integer` is the type
of integer constants in the code, `real` the type of real constants, and
`type(X+Y)` would be the type of all additions.

Obviously, that means that in XL, a value can belong to multiple types.
`2+3*5` belongs to `type(X+Y)`, to `type(X:integer+Y:integer)` or to
`infix`. This makes the XL type system extremely powerful. For example.
a type for even numbers is `type(X:integer when X mod 2 = 0)`.

ELFE also gave me a chance to implement a relatively crude version of
this idea and validate that it’s basically sane. Bringing that idea to
the optimizing compiler was an entirely different affair, though, and is
still ongoing.

=== The LLVM catastrophy

For a while, there were multiple subtly distinct variants of XL which
all shared the same XL0, but had very different run-time constraints.

* Tao3D had the most advanced library, and a lot of code written for it.
But that code often depends on undesirable behaviours in the language,
such as implicit by reference argument passing.
* ELFE had the most advanced type system of all XLR variants, being able
to perform overloading based on the shape of parse trees, and having a
rather complete set of control structures implemented in the library. It
also has an interesting modular structure, and a rather full-featured
interpreter.
* XLR has the most advanced type inference system, allowing it to
produce machine-level instructions for simple cases to get performance
that was on a par with C. Unfortunately, due to lack of time, it fell
behind with respect to LLVM support, LLVM not being particularly careful
about release-to-release source compatibility. And the type inference
was never solid enough to retrofit it in Tao3D, which still uses a much
simpler code generation.
* XL2 was the only self-compiling variant of XL ever written, and still
had by far the most sophisticated handling of generics and most advanced
library. But it has been left aside for a few years. As an imperative
language, it is more verbose and feels heavier to program. Yet it is not
obsolete, as the discussion above demonstrates. Its type system, with
its support for generics or validation, is much more robust than
whatever was ever implemented in all XLR variants. It would need quite a
bit of love to make it really usable, for example improving the standard
library and actually connect XLR as a bytecode back-end as initially
envisioned.

In addition to this divergence, another problem arose externally to the
XL project. The LLVM library, while immensely useful, proved a nightmare
to use, because they purposely don’t care about source cdoe
compatibility between releases. XLR was initially coded against LLVM
2.5, and the majority of Tao3D development occured in the LLVM 2.7 time
frame.

Around release 3.5, LLVM started switching to a completely different
code generation model. Being able to support that new model proved
extremely challenging, in particular for something as complex as Tao3D.
The problem is not unique to Tao3D: the LLVM pipe in the Mesa project
has similar issues. But in Tao3D, it was made much worse precisely
because Tao3D uses both OpenGL and XL, and the Mesa implementation of
OpenGL commonly used on Linux also uses LLVM. If the variants of LLVM
used by the XL runtime and by OpenGL don’t match, mysterious crashes are
almost guaranteed.

From 2015 to 2018, all development of XL and Tao3D was practically stuck
on this problem. It did not help that my job during that time was
especially challenging time-wise. In practice, the development of Tao3D
and XLR was put on hold for a while.

=== Repairing and reconverging

A project that lasted several months, called `bigmerge` allowed me to
repair a lot of the issues:

* The XL2 compiler was brought back into the main tree
* The ELFE interpreter was merged with the main tree, and its modular
approach (designed to allow the use of XL as an extension language) was
incorporated in XL. As a result, ELFE is dead, but it lives on in the
main XL tree. XL was also turned into a library, with a very small
front-end calling that library to evaluate the code.
* The switch from `->` to `is` as the definition operator was
implemented.
* The LLVM "Compatibility Restoration Adaptive Protocol" (LLVM-CRAP)
component of XL was completely redesigned, giving up pre-3.5 versions of
LLVM, but supporting all the recent ones (from 3.7 to 9.0).
* The Tao3D branch of the compiler was forward-ported to this updated
compiler, under the name `FastCompiler`. That work is not complete,
howver, because some of the changes required by the two previous steps
are incompatible with the way Tao3D was interfacing with XL.

This is the current state of the XL tree you are looking at. Not pretty,
but still much better than two years ago.

=== Language redefinition

During all that time, the language definition had been a very vaguely
defined link:XL_Reference_Manual.pdf[TeXMacs document]. This document
had fallen somewhat behind with respect to the actual language
implementation or design. Notably, the type system was quickly
retrofitted in the document. Also, the TexMacs document was monolithic,
and not easy to convert to a web format.

So after a while, I decided to link:#introduction-to-xl[rewrite the
documentation in markdown]. This led me to crystalize decisions about a
few things that have annoyed me in the previous definition, in
particular:

* The ambiguity about formal parameters in patterns, exhibited by the
definition of `if-then-else`. The XL language had long defined
`if-then-else` as follows:
+
[source]
----
if true  then TrueClause      is TrueClause
if false then TrueClause      is false
----
+
There is an obvious problem in that definition. Why should `true` be
treated like a constant while `TrueClause` a formal parameter?
+
The solution proposed so far so far was that if a name already existed
in the context, then we were talking about this name. In other words,
`true` was supposed to be defined elsewhere and not `TrueClause`.
+
This also dealt with patterns such as `A - A is 0`. However, the cost
was very high. In particular, a formal parameter name could not be any
name used in the enclosing context, which was a true nuisance in
practice.
+
More recently, I came across another problem, which was how to properly
insert a computed value like the square root of two in a pattern? I came
up with an idea inspired parameters in `translate` statements in XL2,
which I called a "metabox". The notation `+[[X]]+` in a pattern will
evaluate `X`. To match the square root of 2, you would insert the
metabox `+[[sqrt 2]]+`. To match `true` instead of defining a name `true`,
you would insert `+[[true]]+` instead of `true`.
+
Downside: fix all the places in the documentation that had it backwards.
* The addition of opaque binary data in parse trees, for example to put
an image from a PNG file in an XL program. I had long been thinking
about a syntax like `binary "image.png"` It should also be possible to
declare arbitrary binary data inline, as in
`binary 16#FFFF_0000_FFFF_0000_FF00_00FF_FF00_00FF`.
* Adding a `lambda` syntax for anonymous functions. Earlier versions of
XL would use a catch-all pattern like `(X is X + 1)` to define a lambda
function, so that `(X is X + 1) 3` would be `4`. That pattern was only
recognized in some specific contexts, and in other contexts, this would
be a definition of a variable named `X`. It is now mandatory to add
`lambda` for a catch-all pattern, as in `lambda X is X + 1`, but then
this works in any context.

=== Future work

The work that remains to make XL usable again (in the sense of being as
stable as it was for Tao3D in the 2010-2015 period) includes:

* Complete the work on an Haskell-style type inference system, in order
to make the "O3" compiler work well.
* Repair the Tao3D interface in order to be able to run Tao3D again with
modern LLVM and OpenGL variants.
* Re-connect the XL2 front-end for those who prefer an imperative
programming style, ideally connecting it to XLR as a runtime.
* Sufficient library-level support to make the language usable for real
projects.
* Bootstrapping XLR as a native compiler, to validate that the XLR-level
language is good enough for a compiler. Some of the preparatory work for
this is happening in the `native` directory.
* Implement a Rust-style borrow checker, ideally entirely from the
library, and see if it makes it possible to get rid of the garbage
collector. That would be especially nice for Tao3D, where GC pause,
while generally quite small, are annoying.
* Some reworking of XL0, notably to make it easier to add terminal node
types. An example of use case is version numnbers like `1.0.1`, which
are hard to deal with currently. The distinction between `Integer` and
`Real` is indispensable for evaluation, but it may not be indispensable
at parse time.
* Replace blocks with arrays. Currently, blocks without a content, such
as `( )` or `{ }`, have a blank name inside, which I find ugly. It would
make more sense to consider them as arrays with zero length.
Furthermore, blocks are often used to hold sequences, for example
sequences of instructions. It would be easier to deal with a block
containing a sequence of instructions than with the current block
containing an instruction or a chain of infix nodes.
* Adding a "binary object" node type, which could be used to either
describe data or load it from files. I have been considering a syntax
like:

binary 16#0001_0002_0003_0004_0005_0006_0007_0008_0009
binary "image.jpg"
----

It is unclear if I will be able to do that while at the same time
working on my job at Red Hat and on various other little projects such
as `make-it-quick` or `recorder` (which are themselves off-shoots of XL
development).
